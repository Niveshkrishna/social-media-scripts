    "Description": "Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources.  Compression of Neural Networks (NN) has become a highly studied topic in recent years. The main reason for this is the demand for industrial scale usage of NNs such as deploying them on mobile devices, storing them efficiently, transmitting them via band-limited channels and most importantly doing inference at scale.  A number of papers have been published in last few years, proposing different approaches to minimize the footprints of neural networks. The aim of my talk will be to summarize recent developments and techniques in this field, by quoting benchmarks, algorithms and results from papers. On a superficial level, there are two basic types of compression are Network Pruning and Quantization.  Network Pruning The motive behind network pruning is to selectively nullify or remove some nodes in order to reduce the size of the NN without losing much accuracy. Not only does this reduce the space required to store the model but also reduces the number of computations for sample. A number of papers in the last 2 years have suggested using Bayesian inferences and Variational Dropout , a probabilistic approach to estimating deterministic weights and selectively pruning some of them after sparsifying respective weight matrices.  Quantization Conventionally, weights are stored and operations are performed with 32bit floating point numbers but with the rising need for running models on constrained devices, neural networks can be further compressed by either reducing the number of unique weights by clustering or by reducing the number of bits required represent weights , which also adds a regularizing effect, often resulting in higher accuracy than raw models",

    "Description": "DevOps is evolving fast with the massive growth that chat-based automation and processes has seen in the recent years. We focus on how to leverage the bot-enabled chat platforms like Slack, MSTeams, Mattermost to your advantage in the context of DevOps using various ChatOps techniques. We also focus on the building and deployment of ChatOps using Python, Django, Docker and Kubernetes. An entire array of DevOps processes such monitoring, CI/CD, analytics can be streamlined through different aspects of ChatOps - bots, cross-application workflows and tying together the internal tools, external tools and microservices in any team's DevOps tool-chain. Productivity, speed and transparency in DevOps can be achieved with the use of ChatOps.  Our intention with this workshop would be to focus on the development of ChatOps using Python, Django, Docker and Kubernetes. While several tools are available for developers to build and implement ChatOps for their organization, we believe that the combination of these tools allows for the most versatile, scalable, flexible product. Through our talk, the participants will learn to use these platforms for advanced ChatOps development to automate Dev and DevOps in their teams. We will cover various use cases for all stages of Dev and DevOps cycle. This would give the audience a chance to identify their needs and current state. Next comes the ways these requirements can be tackled through various tools like Python, Django, Docker and Kubernetes(we also cover the advantages and drawbacks of the same). After a well-rounded view of how to implement ChatOps for all kinds of DevOps teams - based on requirements, preferable architecture and choice of language, we end with an interactive Q&A session",

    "Description": "Abstract  Want to learn how you can use the huge amounts of open data available on social platforms like Twitter, GitHub and StackOverflow to build a profile for a software developer? Yes, it's possible using python's sci-kit library. Mine data, extract features, compute quotients and finally, visualize!  Detailed description  The talk will start with an overview of data mining and machine learning concepts, during the course of which common misconceptions about data science would be cleared. As a real life example, the problem statement of job-seekers and recruitment is introduced. This then leads to the solution Vritthi , an open source project and then the technical aspects follow.  Vritthi uses data mining and machine learning to help job-seekers to understand their skill sets and take up courses that would help them improve their technical expertise. Vritthi can automatically calculate a professional quotient by collating data from websites like GitHub, StackOverFlow and LinkedIn. This analysis is a result of parsing thousands of similar profiles available through the APIs of the above websites.  GitHub archive is one of our data sources which actually helps set standards to coding competencies of individual profiles.  Collection of data from GitHub using its API is explained in detail, along with the feature-set used to analyze profiles. Once the data is collected from the API, it passes through the data cleaning phase after which a set of features are extracted. These features could be as simple as number of commits, number of projects in a particular programming language, and so on. Right after this, python sci-kit is used to build the data model that\u2019s required for analysis. A supervised learning model is used which consists of two phases - clustering profiles and computing quotient values. Once the data model is ready, computing technical quotient values per programming language or skill is focused upon. For example, \u201cprogramming languages used\u201d is one of the attributes of the feature vector. Finally, the computed quotients are visualized using a web application which uses Python\u2019s Bokeh visualization library.  Thus, classic data mining and machine learning have been employed on openly available data to solve a specific problem statement.  Who is this talk for?   Python developers who\u2019d like to explore sci-kit  Web developers who\u2019d like to explore python\u2019s bokeh library for data viz.  Entrepreneurs who would like to see how a practical use case is solved using open data   What will participants take away?   Live example of machine learning and how to adopt python sci-kit library in a ML use case  A solid understanding of data science and how it can solve problems in real life  Deeper understanding of GitHub\u2019s API for data extraction and mining",

Both sessions will touch upon Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We will be teaching about the different types of GANs and VAEs and their architectures in general. We will conduct a demo at the end of each session, where we will be generating images of new types of Pokemon.  At the end of the sessions, we will be comparing the results from the images that each generative model's AI has produced. It will be interesting to witness the unfolding of new Pokemon, and learn the reasoning behind the output.",

    "Description": "DNS is a non-encrypted protocol. DNS responses which are sent over UDP or TCP lack confidentiality, privacy and security. DNS often contains password files, geolocations, email service and fax numbers, certificate identity and pinning for TLS and much more. Parsing DNS without encryption would lead to different vulnerabilities such as eavesdropping and spoofing.  DNS over HTTPS(DoH) is a web protocol that argues for sending DNS requests and receiving DNS responses via HTTPS connections, hence providing query confidentiality. DoH provides more than just privacy \u2013 it also helps guarantee the integrity of the response users receives their requests. Because the DNS response is invisible between responder and user, ISPs and others in the end-to-end network chain can't interfere with the responses. Moreover, Responses from the use of recursive resolvers to clients are the most vulnerable to undesired or malicious changes, because generally recursive resolvers do not encrypt any of your queries.  Henceforth, we would be discussing the implementation and parsing of DNS over HTTPS. Further, we provided added support for handling IPv4 and IPv6 DNS packets (A + AAAA records) as well as support for EDNS for edns-client-subnet usage. The integration with HTTP provides a transport suitable for traditional DNS clients seeking access to the DNS. In the end, we will discuss how our client will be sending DNS queries and get DNS responses over HTTP using https:// and implies TLS security integrity and confidentiality.  Furthermore, I plan to put some light on how DNSSEC validation is getting involved here with DNS resolution through HTTP to provide ultimate privacy and security support for \n the DNS packets",

    "Description": "Almost all developers spend countless hours on configuring, tweaking and micro-managing their dotfiles with an obsession to exactly have them like one wants them to be. I do too .  Dotfiles are just configuration files like .vimrc and .gitconfig on your OS, that stores the settings you have for applications/environments/tools to make life easier while giving you more portability.  Well, do you have to use bash scripts for initial setups of your dotfiles? or do you want to setup your dotfiles but don't want to learn or be limited by  Bash? Do you forget to update/maintain your dotfiles periodically? Do you struggle with the installation of applications later on? \n Well, Python could be the answer to all of your problems. With Python, one can easily manage , maintain and do a lot more with their dotfiles.    My talk would start with a basic intro of what exactly are Dotfiles? and what is the common way of setting them up? This helps beginners who are new to the topic, get interested and a quick recap of why dotfiles are important for all developers.    Building up the momentum by visual queues and comparisons through slides, I would show how exactly Python does the same using Homely as Bash does. Later, work through the more intricate details by talking about the features one can implement using Homely and Python highlighting limitations of bash. Like Automation , Logging , git control , debugging , installation of applications and so much more .    Summing up by demonstrating a number of scripts that I will be preparing in-advance to showcase the same features that we just talked about. This helps people grasp the talk, the topic, and \" the why we are doing, what we are doing \" part.    Ending the talk , with a round of questions and showing the setup I use after months of searching through dotfiles repositories to leave them open to all the options they can choose from for setting up their dotfiles and pick the best setup from the knowledge they just gained.

    "Description": "The aim of this workshop is to  give a hands on coding experience for writing machine learning / deep learning  algorithms from scratch without using external frameworks alongside visualising the model and explaining its predictions using LIME.  from-scratch-to-ml  The primary goals of this library is - - This framework is intended to be and educational tool to learn deep Learning . - To bridge the gap between the theoretical and coding aspects of machine learning algorithms. - To write intuitive blogs as python notebooks so as to juxtapose theory and code . Explaining the fundamentals of the algorithm from the very basics. - To minimise the use of external dependencies except the fundamental ones like numpy and matplotlib .\n - To make sure that the developed algorithms are coherent with already existing machine learning frameworks.   The library is still in a nascent stage but will take shape in a couple of months. Given that the commit frequency is huge. The audience is requested to be patient.   LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) -  When you are writing a machine algorithm from scratch you want to make sure that your results are coherent and your model is learning the features it is meant to learn. LIME explains why your model behaved the way it did.   I will quote excerpts from their blog below -  Imagine we want to explain a classifier that predicts how likely it is for the image to contain a tree frog. We take the image on the left and divide it into interpretable components (contiguous superpixels).      As illustrated below, we then generate a data set of perturbed instances by turning some of the interpretable components \u201coff\u201d (in this case, making them gray). For each perturbed instance, we get the probability that a tree frog is in the image according to the model. We then learn a simple (linear) model on this data set, which is locally weighted\u2014that is, we care more about making mistakes in perturbed instances that are more similar to the original image. In the end, we present the superpixels with highest positive weights as an explanation, graying out everything else.   Even from a human's perspective these explanations do make sense.  SOURC",

With thousands of people working towards democratising artificial intelligence (AI) , we have seen an explosion in the availability of machine learning libraries that make it simpler to build and deploy models for a wide range of tasks. From finance to art, every field has been revolutionised by the  introduction of AI.   At the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) we work on understanding the fundamental particles that constitute the universe by performing various experiments in particle physics. Of late, we have experienced a stratospheric rise in deep learning applications to various problems - RNNs, CNNs, and GANs - that have yielded promising results.  Like, this stuff is so cool. It works!  We delve into the development of one such project as it evolves from a set of scripts into a full-blown framework for supervised learning in high-energy physics.   In this talk we will detail the evolution on the DeepJet Framework. It will delieate the development isssues, and how it evolved from a set of scripts hastily patched together to a structured, cross-platform framework built on top of Tensorflow and Keras.    The library is a WIP so we're shipping updates on a daily basis with the goal of improving usability with focus on documenting our existing code base.     Initially envisaged to support the development of the namesake jet-tagger in the CMS Experiment at CERN, it has grown to encompass multiple purposes within the collaboration. It is aimed at outlining how to go from a set of scripts to building a library that is used by hundreds of scientists in the world's largest physics research collaboration.    The presentation will describe the major features the environment sports: simple out-of-memory training with a multi-threaded approach to maximally exploit the hardware acceleration, simple and streamlined I/O to help bookkeeping of the developments, and finally Docker image distribution, to simplify the deployment of the whole ecosystem on multiple datacenters.    The talk will also cover future development aimed at improving user experience. ",

Nim is a statically typed, compiled language with a focus on efficiency. It is versatile and borrows much of its constructs and standard library design from Python https://nim-lang.org  As Python programmers, we are used to a language which is expressive, intuitive and versatile. Python is widely lauded for its productivity, minimalistic syntax, standard library feature set and is an inspiration to newer languages like Go, Swift, and Julia. However, there are some areas like speed, distribution, and multicore processing where it lacks a good solution. Nim is a statically typed and high-performance garbage-collected language which builds upon Python\u2019s strengths and addresses someone its weakness in an innovative way. This talk introduces Nim to Python programmers by diving into powerful language design, syntax, data and control structures, static analysis, metaprogramming, portability/distribution and standard library features.

Python with its free and open source libraries are giving wide variety yet simple and effective set of tools to visualise and analyse geospatial data. The current workshop is directed for beginners of Python programming language, who have basic understanding on computing and data formats. The primary objective of the workshop is to introduce and give hands on training on selected list of FOSS libraries for geospatial analysis. The workshop as a do it yourself fashion tries to solve two real world problems in Geographical Information System (GIS) and its geospatial data sources.  The workshop comprised of three components:  Component 1  Python environment and work flow setup, an assisted task of setting up the Docker and Jupyter notebook setup. Setting up the Geographical Information System (GIS) environment with extended discussion. Setting up of GIS tools such as FOSS QGIS and Google earth. This component is comprised of four exercises. 1. Introduction to vector data, 2. Introduction to raster data, 3. binary and text file formats of geospatial data, 4. Introduction to tools of GIS, 5. Introduction to literal programming- Jupyter notebook  Component 2  Find characteristics of road network(type of road network, length of the type) within a 1X1 km grid. The data source is Open Street Map (OSM) road network data on a city level (60X60km size). This operation is operationally simple such as measure a line feature but computationally intensive as the operation comprised of geometry within operation on dense road network seen in urban setup. Libraries such as Shapely, Fiona, Geopandas and rtree index will be used for the fast processing of this operation. This component comprised of three exercises 1. Find distance between two points 2. Find distance between two points constrained by another vector 3. Find distance between large number of points in for loop  Component 3  Find cloud cover percentage over area of interest. The data source is Landsat satellite imagery. Searching cloud free Landsat images over an Area of Interest for a temporal extent of a year or more is manual and time consuming. Applying cloud cover detection algorithm could make this operation automatic. Libraries such as rasterio, Geopandas, Fiona, and libraries related to landsat algorithms will be used for this task. This component comprised of two exercises 1. Convert the imagery in geotiff into numpy arrays 2.

    "Description": "Millions of visitors visit business websites every day and each one of them takes different set of steps in order to seek the right information/product. Yet most of them leave disappointed or dejected for some reason and very few get to the right page within the website. In this kind of situation, it becomes difficult to find out if the visitor actually got the information that he was looking for? Also, the individual journeys of these visitors can\u2019t be compared to each other since every visitor has done different set of activities. So, how can we know more about these journeys and compare these visitors to each other?\nSequence Embedding is a powerful way that offers us the flexibility to not only compare any two distinct visitors entire journey in terms of similarity but also to predict the probability of visitor\u2019s conversion. Sequence embeddings essentially helps us to move away from using traditional features to make predictions and considers not only the order of the activities of a user but also the average time spent on each of the unique pages to translate into more robust features and used in Supervised Machine Learning across multiple use cases (next possible action prediction, converted vs non-converted, product classification)\u00a0.Using traditional Machine learning models on the advanced features like sequence embeddings, we can achieve tremendous results in terms of prediction accuracy but the real benefit lies in visualizing all these user journeys and observing how distinct are these paths from the ideal ones.  This session will unfold the process creating sequence embeddings for each user\u2019s journey in python and use them to build machine learning classification model to predict visitor conversion along with comparing all the user journeys in terms of similarity score",

    "Description": "Abstract  The primary purpose of this talk to describe how we are using python and Sklearn to model and analyse time series sensor data. In particular, I will walk through how we use Python to process data from an IoT enabled sensor attached to a cricket bat, build machine learning models on the data, and use open source tools to deploy our models in the sensor device as a smart IoT application.  Description  With the steep increase in the number of smart-things connected to the internet, the amount of data that is being generated by such devices is increasing exponentially. However, much of that data is not useful and therefore filtering unuseful data is an important task. How do we filter the important part and remove the noise from sensor data streams to generate actionable insights?  To demonstrate the problem we are placing a sensor device on a cricket bat. The IoT device is a miniaturised, wireless MEMS inertial measurement unit (IMU). The IMU incorporates three-axis sensing of bat acceleration and angular velocity with a low-power Bluetooth to transmit this data to a mobile.  First, we gather event-based data rather than storing the entire stream. This again poses the question: how do we define an event? What makes an event unique from the surrounding \u2018non-event\u2019 context? These are some of the questions that need to be answered in order to define an event. Watching a cricket batter stand and prepare to swing, the human brain continuously filters its visual perception and is able to detect and differentiate a swing from the pre- and post-swing activity. We need to be able to automate that same process. Some data instances can be tagged while other can\u2019t be. This helps in training and evaluating machine learning models later.  Secondly, After we have extracted time series data based on the instances, we can start analysing these event-based sets of data to understand the language of sensor data. For this, we are using Jupyter Lab to interactively work with data. How does an accelerometer data depict the real world physical motion? This step helps us find the relation between the real world actions and the sensor data set. Well, the extraction process will be prone to noises.  The data comes in CSV files, python seems the right choice for us to read and analyse the data. Pandas and offer data frames that come handy to rapidly form and validate hypothesis interactively in Jupyter notebooks. Any analysis is incomplete without visualisation, that's where Matplotlib helps us understand the data better. We quickly test the machine learning models by using Sklearn, which has most of the standard algorithms already implemented. This keynote will describe some of the analysis (along with python code) to show how we have taken several steps right from forming the hypothesis to implementing a solution in the device level layer. All of this demonstrates how Python and its rich set of libraries are helpful in forming solutions to some of the product related features.  Thirdly, we need to automate the task of classifying a particular instance from the stream. For this to happen, we can either feed a machine learning model or create a rule-based algorithm which can classify the events into buckets.  Now every step has its own set of challenges, firstly the application we are working on involves using motion sensors attached to the back of a cricket bat. There are network constraints in the field. If a sportsperson wants to know real-time analytics from the device, the segregation needs to happen offline. We have to deploy the models on the miniature sensor devices because sometimes the players don\u2019t even carry their mobile phones to the playing area. Therefore our objective is to enable the devices to remain independent in running machine learning algorithms by themselves",

    "Description": "Abstract  Think of wireless internet, but has the wire somewhere. Serverless architecture still has the server behind :P.  What serverless actually means that developer should focus on the code rather than thinking about the servers. As a technique, it removes most of the manel parts of an application, so you can actually spend your day coding. This means that you, developers, can quickly create apps that handle production-ready traffic. You do not have to actively manage scaling for your applications. You do not have to provision the server, or to pay for resources that are unused. The serverless movement started with the release of AWS Lambda, a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) compute service. But serverless is much more than just FaaS  Chatbots have been around for quite a long time. But why this sudden surge and interest in chatbots now? Well, there are various reasons. Unlike the earlier days, many AI and NLP capabilities are now available as consumable services. Also, serverless technologies make chatbots easier to build and scale. The question is, how is the backend served? Would you set up a dedicated server (or a cluster of servers)? That\u2019s costly, painful, and time-consuming! or You will deploy it to Heroku, which will eventually sleep (only happens in the free tier) if no one uses your chatbot.  Imagine suddenly, traffic increased your chatbot is used by thousands of people at a time.  When Heroku free tier is over, the application crashed or you exceeded memory limit. What would you do now? That\u2019s where serverless technology can help.   Benefits of serverless    No Administration - We can deploy our code without provisioning anything beforehand, or manage anything afterward. There is no concept of a fleet, an instance, or even an operating system.    Scalability - One doesn't have to care about auto-scaling,  No need to show alerts or write scripts to scale up and down. With serverless, we can handle quick bursts of traffic.    Cost - Function-as-a-service (FaaS) compute and managed services charged based on actual usage rather than pre-provisioned capacity. This means one pay the amount we use, so if we use service for 10 sec then we pay for 10 sec.    Faster Development - Now loop between having an idea and deploying to production is shortened because no one need to manage anything after deployment, smaller teams can ship more features. It's easier than ever to make your idea live.    Easy Integration With Other Services Going serverless allows a seamless integration to various other cloud services from the same provider. For example, if you are using the AWS platform for chatbots, then you can use DynamoDB for the database, write programming logic as Lambda functions, and expose them through the API Gateway.    Session key Takeaways  The main question is how to write code which is serverless compliant. This is where this session will help you. This talk will help people to move a step ahead of the traditional way of writing code as some of you had already developed chatbot, I will share how can you can write the simple chatbot in python and can take leverage of serverless to deploy and publish. I will cover   Serverless Framework principals  AWS Lambda, Amazon Lex and API Gateway  How to write a chatbot in python and create a Lambda function  How to troubleshoot in a serverless world",

    "Description": "Take it from someone who has introduced an exorbitantly high number of bugs in empty files for most of his life: debugging is hard indeed. But since the dawn of time, developers have been debugging code: there's no escaping that. Software testing, as the elders would tell you, is one of the greatest weapons in your arsenal against those bugs. It's easy to write tests. It helps you write more robust software. And it really helps you sleep at night: and your on-call ops team would love you! But testing is also deeply mystified, unfortunately. Beginners, and sometimes even seasoned developers, generally have a difficult time just to get started: so they eventually miss out on this easy way to attain peace of mind.  This talks aims at removing all the mystery around software testing in Python, and give the attendees a head-start into the easiest way of writing tests for their code. As part of being a Python developer for the past 8 years and leading a team of developers building enterprise-grade software for the past 4 years, I've learnt immensely about the important role of software testing in building scalable, durable software; and also a better, pragmatic way of thinking about testing in Python. This talk aims at providing a distilled version of my learning to the audience: both beginners to Python, and seasoned Pythonistas.  The talk would broadly cover these topics:   A formal way of thinking about software testing / Why you should even bother about writing tests?  Writing the simplest of tests in Python / Brief exploration of unittest and pytest  Introduction to mocking in Python / In-depth exploration of mock and how to effectively use it for mocking any type of scenario in your code  Writing tests for complex applications / working code examples from real life \u2014 This section would contain walkthrough of tests written in a few real-life applications and Python libraries, and a discussion on how to add test coverage for things that might not seem very straightforward to mock in a unit test.  A few (opinionated) recommendations about testing   Apart from providing to the audience an easy-to-grasp framework of thinking about software testing, this talk aims to teach by examples from real world. Complex and not so straightforward concepts would be explained with code samples and tests from production, so it's easy for the audience to truly grasp them. The talk also features anecdotes from my own experience in building software to give the audience better context", 
    "Last Updated": "15 May, 2018", 
    "Prerequisites": "This talk is intended for newcomers to Python (who might never have written a test yet), as well as experienced developers (who might not be writing tests effectively). There are no technical pre-requisites for this talk. The key takeaways would be patterns you can directly start using in writing tests for your own code",

Mozilla\u2019s DeepSpeech and Common Voice projects are there to change this. In contrast to classic STT approaches, DeepSpeech features a modern end-to-end deep learning solution. Based on Baidu's Deep Speech research paper, it trains a model by machine learning techniques. This model directly translates raw audio data into text - without any domain specific code in between. To train systems like DeepSpeech, an extremely large amount of voice data is required. Most of the data used by large companies isn\u2019t available to the majority of people. That's why Mozilla launched Common Voice, a project to help make voice recognition open to everyone",

You should better start praying to almighty to give you strength and endurance to support yet another language in your app\".  In this talk, we'll see how do we support localization and serve our app in different languages, based on what language the client wants to communicate in. As a backend, we should be language agnostic and allow all clients to communicate with us in one of the languages we support.  We'll see how to support translation for static data (using makemessages / compilemessages) and dynamic data, using various third-party services such as django-translations and transifex.  Here, static data is translations for all the fields, error messages etc. that the app already has and dynamic data is the custom data input by the user in the app.  This would enable you to have your admin panel, as well as RESTful APIs, served in different languages",

Some of them are really puzzling, right? I felt the same when I first came across all these intricacies.  But don't worry, such behaviors, are mostly the consequences of strings being [immutable] [sequences] in Python. In this talk we'll be going through the concepts behind such snippets in detail, so that next time when you see such examples, the answer seems natural to you.  Finally, we'll try to answer some interesting questions like,   How does string concatenation work?  What's the best way of building large strings in Python? (It may actually depend on your use-case)  What happens when you multiply a string by a boolean?  How strings in Python differ from strings in other languages like JavaScript, C++?   and many more",

Typically, when your Python project grows beyond a few modules and your team size is more than a couple of developers, having the right tools built into your project development workflow saves one from a lot of surprises (and perhaps late night calls). In this talk, we start with challenges typically seen in Python Projects and look at ways of overcoming them, so that the velocity of code deployment increases. Specifically we are going to be looking at tools that are out there that allow you to -   Properly track dependencies ( pip , virtualenv and the new Pipenv )  Have a separate Dev and Production environment - so that dependencies in Dev environment don't spill into Production environment.  Ensure that the builds are deterministic (across developer/build machines and time.)  Enforce certain coding guidelines and capture the potential 'run-time' errors right during the development ( pylint )  and Eventually Dockerize your application.",

    "Description": "Talk Abstract  This talk aims to introduce Facebook's Deep Learning library - PyTorch. PyTorch is increasing becoming popular due to it's powerful features and shallow learning curve, making it accessible and easy to use to a larger community. This talk discusses about the 'Autograd' package, which is central to all neural networks in PyTorch. It also entails details about the different features and functionalities of PyTorch as well as equip the audience on how to create simple and complex Neural Networks in PyTorch. PyTorch helps to create dynamic computation graphs that allow you to change how the network behaves on the fly unlike static computation graphs. It offers modularity which enhances the ability to debug or see within the network.  Outline of the Talk  The talk will be broadly divided into 3 broad parts.  Part 1 will be an Introduction to PyTorch. This part will focus on the use and need for PyTorch as a deep learning framework. This will be followed by instructions on how to setup PyTorch and a look at the basic building blocks behind the framework.  Part 2 will dive more into the features of PyTorch, mainly it's AutoGrad package which lies at the heart of all Neural Networks created in PyTorch and PyTorch's ability to create dynamic computational graphs as opposed to the static computational graphs offered by some of it's counterparts (such as TensorFlow and Caffe).  Part 3 will be a more 'hands on' part where the talk will focus on how to create and build simple as well as complex neural networks (such as Convolutional Neural Networks) with the framework",

    "Description": "In computer vision, object detection is scanning and searching for an object in an image or a video (which is just sequence of images). Whereas, object tracking is like you are spying on someone and following it. Done in motion images like in animated gifs or videos, we want to track how an object is moving, where is it going, or its speed.  Although it has been studied for dozens of years, object detection and tracking remains an open research problem . The difficulty level of this problem highly depends on how you define the object to be detected and tracked. If only a few visual features, such as a specific color, are used as representation of an object, it is fairly easy to identify all pixels with same color as the object. On the other extremity, the face of a specific person, which full of perceptual details and interfering information such as different poses and illumination, is very hard to be accurately detected, recognized and tracked.  Thus, I believe it is important to address such challenges via a comparative study of object tracking and object detection in python. Here, I aim to present my own experience in tackling the problems while I tested different algorithms for the same",

The reason I'm interested in taking this up is because there are people who develop beautiful things and might want to let people to use it even on a mobile interface. The problem is not everyone's good with app development. So in such cases, deploying the beautiful things in the form of a bot would be a great idea.  Bots can be of 2 types :   Conversational  Command based   I'll be taking up the command based bot to help people get a feeling of this topic.  Also, through the example I'll be giving, I'll try to make people understand as to what APIs are and how to use existing one. Later I'll show  them how to create your own Python APIs because APIs make lives easier for programmers and it's always a good practise to know how to create an API as you never know when someone else might need it.  CONTENTS AND ORDER OF THE TALK   I'll be starting off with an introduction about myself and then I'll move on to what are bots.  I'll then be explaining about why we could probably use these bots on Telegram, Discord, Slack and so on.  Thereafter I'll be talking about the Telegram API for Python to help you interact with the bot and telling you how to use it. Before this, I'll show them how to prepare a bot on Telegram and get the Token.  After this, I'll be talking about the importance of an API and utilizing existing ones as it makes your job much simpler.  Slowly, I'll shift my focus on to how to build an API. I'll be explaining this using an example.  Then using the Telegram Bot API and the API we build for Syntaxdb.com, we'll be creating a Telegram bot.  Lastly, I'll summarise and entire talk and will take up a couple of questions.   The entire talk will be based on a GitHub repository. The code links will be given to everyone for future reference",

    "Description": "Bitcoin has been gaining popularity in the recent years due to its market value. But more importantly, the underlying technology is gaining the attention among the developers. Many developer communities inspired by bitcoin have created their own platform to use the underlying technology widely known as \"blockchain\" to achieve decentralization. Ethereum is one such platform that has created a blockchain platform which allows developers to develop their own decentralized applications (dApps) in the ethereum network by coding the logic in the execulatable contracts called \"smart contracts\" . Although ethereum has gained a huge fame due to its smart contract implementation to create decentralized applications, it imposes developer to write the logic in an ethereum's domain-specific language called Solidity. In addition to coding in a new language, it mandates the developer to set up a new develop environment.  NEO blockchain platform provides a convenient way to develop smart contracts in general purpose programming language. NEO achieves this by providing compilers to compile code written in most of the languages to bytecode that can be executed in NEO virtual machine. Currently, NEO allows compilation of python smart contracts through neo-python project.  This is the first blockchain project to provide such a freedom to the developer.  NEO project provides plenty of benefits over other blockchain platforms out there. \nIt plans to achieve smart economy by creating a strong digital identity. It achieves faster transaction rate which is the key to scale any platform. NEO is being referred to as the \"New Ethereum\" due to its increasing popularity.  I plan on conducting a workshop to create a decentralized application by developing and deploying smart contract using neo-python.  Following would be the agenda of the workshop.   Introduction to Bitcoin, Blockchain, and consensus to achieve decentralization. (30 mins)  Introduction to NEO and Setting up a NEO platform (30 mins)  Creating and deploying Hello World contract using Python (15 mins)  Creating a Proof of Ownership system (30 mins)  Creating a user interface to create a complete Proof of Ownership DApp. (20 mins)  Creating an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) using an existing template and Q&A (25 mins)   ** This is a rough estimation of time and topics as of now.

This kind of radiation bursts can cause damage to space and ground based technological infrastructure. \nHence monitoring such solar activity is crucial.  Research Work  There has been considerable research in the field of solar activity monitoring as done by NASA Space Stations. Primary research includes locating sunspot regions or potential regions of high solar density along with detecting solar flares from the solar data.  Solar Physics in Python  In the field of solar physics, IDL is regarded as the primary programming language for solar data analysis purpose. But due to its less popularity and complexity there has been transition to using a much simpler yet robust language Python. The SunPy Project is such a community developed open source project for solar data analysis purpose based in Python.  So how using python we can benefit the astrophysics and helio-physics community to query solar data and analyze them much more efficiently and produce much more insightful results ?

    "Description": "FastText has been open-sourced by Facebook in 2016 and with its release, it became the fastest and most cutting edge library in Python for text classification and word representation. It is to be seen as a substitute for gensim package's word2vec. It includes the implementation of two extremely important methodologies in NLP i.e Continuous Bag of Words and Skip-gram model. Fasttext performs exceptionally well with supervised as well as unsupervised learning.  The tutorial will be divided in following four segments :    0-10 minutes: The talk will begin with explaining common paradigms that are present right now. Are deep learning really necessary?    10-15  mins: what are word representations    15-25 minutes: The code will be shown and explained line by line for both the models (CBOW and Skip-gram) on a standard textual labelled dataset. Showing how you can do fast prototyping with minimal code.    25-30: How to use the pre-trained word embeddings released by FastText on various languages and where to use them. Why python3 is the best language for multi-language support and a note on general deep learning using fasttext.    30-40 minutes: For QA session. ",

    "Description": "Kubernetes is considered as the new Kernel of the Cloud. It's a distributed computing platform letting users not have to care about infra and helping them concentrate mainly on business logic. By having your web app deployed on a kubernetes cluster you can make sure your app is highly available, and can fail-over when there's a problem.  One of the main goals of the Kubernetes project is to democratize distributed computing. With Kubernetes being open source, Companies do not have to redo the mundane task of writing a distributed computing platform to achieve high availability, automated deployment, scaling and management of your applications. Kuberentes will take care of that for you. Kubernetes is also considered as a container orchestrator, as it manages containers to achieve the above said goals.  In this talk:    We will first write a basic python web app.    Next, We will go through what a container is    Containers are becoming the de-facto way of deploying applications as they remove the complexities of dependency management,etc.    Running apps on Individual Containers provide the isolation almost to that of a Virtual Machine without having the overhead of having individual Kernels as they all share the host kernel. Isolation is provided by using kernel level features like cgroups and namespaces.    We will containerize the application using docker and push it to a Container Registry.    Once we have the image deployed to a registry, this image will be used to create instances i.e containers of the web app.      We will next create a kubernetes cluster on Azure, all along going through what a Kubernetes cluster is, and its components.    We will then deploy our python web app onto the cluster. Now As we have our python web app up and running, We can then do some experiments on how Kubernetes self-heals the application when a node goes down,etc.    After that I will run down some points on where Kubernetes is being\n   used, its impact.    To Finally answer the question, Is Containers and Kubernetes worth all the Hype ?  This talk will be demo focused, But before going to a demo we will have some slides explaining the overview of the components and how they work.  By the end of the talk, Audience will have a brief overview of what containers and kubernetes are, and how to deploy a web app on Kubernetes. From this overview, Audience can start digging deeper online and know more",

    "Description": "Mention of \u201cCancer\u201d evokes words like tumor, chemotherapy, hair loss, vomiting and pain. Interestingly our knowledge and thereby cancer treatment has changed radically in the past few years and is changing rapidly every passing day. In 2003, human genome was sequenced and for the first time we could read entire human DNA from end to end. Interestingly DNA and cancer are deeply connected. Scientists deciphered that always a change in DNA (mutation) led to cancer (oncogenic mutation). Cigarette smoking, alcohol, pollution etc only led to such DNA change (oncogenic mutations). This led to numerous diagnostic companies starting to extract and sequence tumor DNA, to detect the root cause of each patient tumor. While drug companies formulated new drugs that targeted specific DNA change (mutation). These were called targeted therapies which were very different from chemotherapy in being very precise, less toxic, less side effects and they could be taken orally just like any regular pill. Thus, an oncologist (cancer doctor) could treat a cancer tumor effectively if s/he knew the precise location of mutation in the entire patient tumor DNA and the drug that targeted it. Suddenly oncologists in India and elsewhere, found themselves struggling to comprehend tumor DNA and the technology around it. Already burdened with tomes of ever changing patient treatment guidelines, now they were needed to integrate tumor DNA information to make accurate treatment decisions. For eg. NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, USA) which publishes treatment guidelines for all cancer for oncologists across the world, published lung cancer guidelines that is 271 pages long. To this, add the complex data of patient\u2019s tumor DNA, various mutation databases, clinical trials and research papers. Modern day oncologist are often overwhelmed. They need tools to simplify and hasten their decision making. I am a molecular biologist who understands the tumor DNA and the technologies around it. As Chief Scientist (molecular oncology) of Neuberg diagnostic lab, I also write patient DNA reports that guide oncologists to take treatment decisions.  While meeting various oncologists and marketing them different DNA tests for different type of cancers, I got acutely aware of the problems oncologists faced. To simplify their decision making, I created algorithms that combined patient\u2019s clinical history, histo-pathology data, molecular test decisions, mutational databases and NCCN guidelines. Subsequently I coded these integrated and complex decision algorithms as Python programs that can be executed from a browser. They are available for free and oncologists are/can use it.\nPrograms in Python for lung cancer and colorectal cancers: https://sites.google.com/view/molecularpathology/programming?authuser=0 \nMy article on need of Python programing for cancer treatment: https://sites.google.com/view/molecularpathology/programming/is-it-time-for-precision-medicine-app?authuser=",

    "Description": "With the advent of Tableau and languages like Python and R, converting raw data into meaningful insights is much easier and convenient than before. Tableau is a tool used to visually represent data and is powerful enough to analyze the given data at any required level. At an industry perspective, the tool comes handy in finding the trends in marketing and sales with a click of a button.  Introducing Python to Tableau using TabPy can help define calculated fields in Python, thereby giving it the power to leverage a large number of Machine-learning libraries right from the visualizations. This widens the scope of its applications to any field that deals with big data and its analytics. Optimisation and cross-sharing of data models facilitated by TabPy immensely enhance the efficiency and usability of the tool. With just a few lines of code, we can churn out predictive models and increase the accuracy of future predictions.  The talk will primarily focus on:   An introduction to data manipulation and visualization using Tableau.  An overview of the steps to leverage TabPy in Tableau.  The impact and advantages of Tableau-TabPy combination in the real world.",

You could also view the same rich displays in multiple environments - on the web, on your desktop, in your shell or even your IDE . But how is this possible without duplicating logic, re-inventing the wheel multiple times? How do visualization libraries like Bokeh, Plotly work across frontends - like jupyter notebook, jupyterlab and nteract?  This talk explores Jupyter's display system and how it handles multiple display formats in multiple environments. We will see how this idea is applied in some open visualization libraries.  After this talk, you will know how to integrate your python objects better with the notebook. You will also get an idea of how to create a visualization library that works across the Jupyter ecosystem of tools.  Duration 45 mins (Content can be modified to fit into 30-minute slot too)  Outline - Setting some terminology for the rest of the talk (what is a frontend, kernel, displayhooks) (5 mins) - How to use Jupyter's display hooks for your python objects with the notebook (10 mins) - The Jupyter messaging protocol - specifically, the display_data and update_data messages (5 mins) - Custom mime-types (and this is the secret to Jupyter's display system!) - separating what to display from how to display it (10 mins) - Examples of custom mime-types in the wild (a look at altair , vdom , plotly and more) (10 mins)  Additional notes This proposal might seem to overlap with another - Jupyter Notebooks: Internals and Extension - which explores how jupyter works under the hood and how to create alternative frontends. My talk's focus will be different, and will dive into a very specific part of Jupyter - the display system - in depth",

A video image of a person talking is analyzed and shapes made by the lips are examined which are then turned into sounds by comparing to a dictionary to create matches to the words being spoken. In this talk, we will use a VGG+GRU network which is based on CNN+LSTM layers to predict the text spoken by the speaker and classify it into 20 classes from audio-less videos, consisting of 10 words and 10 phrases. This will be done on the audiovisual MIRACL-VC1 dataset.  The talk will cover how a CNN+LSTM can be used to recognize a sequence of shapes formed by the mouth and then match it to a specific word or sequence of words spoken from Visual Feed. It will include data-preprocessing, creation of CNN and LSTM layers using Python and applying them on the dataset",

    "Description": "Data Wrangling involves detection, correction, removal, or otherwise dealing with inaccurate and corrupted data. The most common file formats in which data can be stored are CSV, JSON, and XML. However, many times, the data is not available in the desired format and rather is available in some unconventional file formats like PDF or PPT. Parsing PDFs may seem like a daunting task to many as it is quite an unpredictable format. Simply stated, PDF is a hard-to-parse format. This workshop will help you understand the concept of Wrangling PDFs in an easy and fun way.  Following will be the flow of this workshop:   Self Introduction  Brief Introduction to Data Wrangling  Why prefer CSV, JSON, or XML?  Why avoid using PDFs?  Basics of RegEx based Pattern Matching  Parsing PDFs Programmatically using \"slate\" and \"pdfminer\": Getting hands-on  Inefficient Parsing?

    "Description": "Large Python codebases can be hard to maintain. If we make it easier to understand our code bases, we make everyone more productive and help each other write fewer bugs.  Static typing is one of remedies that can improve readability and maintainability of the code.  That's why Python now features optional static typing as described in PEP-484 , implemented as Mypy .  Mypy is an experimental variant of Python that let's you add optional type annotations to type check your Python code. And it works great on both Python 2.7 and 3.3+.  Adopting static typing is easier that you think, you can start on a small set of code and move on to bigger pieces.  In this talk I'll share about,   PEP-484 and Introduction of type annotations in Python 3.5  Use cases of Mypy and how to use it with Python 2 and 3  Project typeshed and how to leverage it  Lessons I learned by type hinting the project Twine   We\u2019ll also discuss how to make it a seamless part of your project; what order to approach things in; and some powerful new packages that make it even easier today to add static types to your Python codebase than ever before",

When we were trying to build a robotics system that is primarily modular and upgradeable, we ended up using Python to power the brain of the project.  In this talk, we'll discuss how we designed the event loop, responsible for controlling the mechanical actions and state of a robot snake.   Animating multiple motors concurrently at different speeds to different positions.  Foreground and background tasks.  Interrupting ongoing tasks.   We will discuss best practices when performing asynchronous actions in Python, and how to ensure actions are completed within a bounded time.\nFinally we touch one of the lesser known 'features' of Python, the Global Interpreter Lock.  GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing at once. Two threads calling a function may take twice as much time as a single thread calling the function twice. We'll discuss some of the real world implications of the GIL, along with some considerations that must be taken while writing highly synchronous Python code",

In this talk I'll cover the following:   Hook up a microphone to a raspberry pi and be able to capture wav files on python.  Use an online API like Google's Speech API to convert the wav to text.  Give a background on what intents and entities (slots) are.  Installing open source software like Snips  Encoding our intents and example sentences and training the open sources software  Calling a functions to do particular activities   At the end there'll be a cool demo",

    "Description": "Hey everybody!  Ever tried to webscrape?  Ever faced a \"No robots allowed! No web scraping allowed!\" message from a favorite site?  This talk is for meant for you.  Usually when you're done building a fancy web scraper and begin running the homebrew'd tool on your favorite site there's chances you'll face a block on your IP address preventing your computer from accessing more resources and therefore downloading the contents of the website. Your tool maybe fast, it might be scalable, it might be the best written scraper out there, but with just one IP address under your belt, it's easy for giants to block your ip address and prevent you from getting that precious data, especially if you've built a threadsafe and multi-node webscraper.  Enter The Onion Router,  The ToR project, allows you to use the the internet vis-a-vis a proxy and visit the same website under a different endpoint ip address, but that's just for one instance of ToR.  What if you ran, say 200? at once?  200 ip addresses > 1 ip address.  With 200 endpoints and the latest update to the requests library, you can now use your multi-threaded and resource hungry webscraper and it can(not) be stopped! Whatever your rate of data collection, you can 200x it!  The stack is simple, you open a SOCKS5 proxy per ToR endpoint, connect it to a request with it's own port number and you're good for that one request, same for multiple requests. You can build a task scheduler to orchestrate the url to scrape and the port number the tor endpoint is on and have the entire application running on a cloud service provider to ensure you face no bandwidth issues.  The demo centered around the talk will attempt to rapidly and quickly scrape users from the famous social network Ask.fm which is known to restrict users from retreiving from their site if you attempt to download more than 4 users in under a second, but with the hack in place, you'll be retrieving close to maximum efficiency on a DigitalOcean droplet , but this can be applied to virtually any website and any cloud provider.  Never pay for webscraping again!  Thanks and see you at PyCon! \n-Lokesh Poovaraga",

    "Description": "Most machine learning algorithms require feature vectors as inputs. In pattern recognition and machine learning, a feature vector is an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represent some object (image, text, sound). Feature engineering, the practice of extraction of features from objects is a combination of art and science; it requires the experimentation of multiple possibilities and automated techniques with the intuition and knowledge of the domain expert. Automating this process is called \"feature learning,\" where a machine learns the features itself.  One way to obtain features is to use the 'Bag-of-Features' model, the idea behind which is to simplify object representation as a collection of its subparts. Originally used for representing text data, the \"Bag-of-Words\" methodology can be extended to different types of objects resulting in models such as \"Bag-of-Visual-Words,\" \"Bag-of-Audio-Words.\" The significance of these models in the age of self-learning deep networks still holds because of their ability to work with limited data.  The contents of the talk are:   Introduction to Feature Engineering  Working with Text Data  Understanding 'Bag-of-Words'  Example: Text Classification  Working with Image Data  Introduction to 'Bag-of-Visual-Words'  Example: Image Classification  Comparing the performance to CNN  Overview of 'Bag-of-Audio-Words'  Generalizing 'Bag-of-Features'   This talk primarily discusses Bag-of-Words, Bag-of-Visual-Words through an example of text classification and image classification respectively. It also covers the concepts that generalize to models other than Bag-of-Features. The goal is to acquaint the audience who have previously worked on numeric data with some ideas to get started with text and multimedia data",

    "Description": "Websites and blogs have become a common trend amongst professionals to display not just their resumes but also their daily work items. Static blog generators have gained popularity over the last few years .  People who have been using Wordpress, Blogspot or Blogger are now shifting to Pelican , Jekyll  etc. One major annoyance was that Wordpress had a huge attack surface. Everytime someone found out a Wordpress exploit, your site was at risk.  When comparing Blogger vs Pelican, the Slant community recommends Pelican for most people. In the question \u201cWhat are the best solutions for a personal blog?\u201d Pelican is ranked 10th while Blogger is ranked 14th.  Python is becoming more and more popular amongst programmers and so is Pelican . \nPelican is a static blog generator and supports several formats like Markdown , ASCII etc . It  turns Markdown and some Jinja templates into the Full Stack Python site. Its beauty lies in its simplicity and even a non programmer can get started with Pelican in just a few lines of code and plain text .   Over the past few years people have shifted from Wordpress to Pelican .This is because a static site has basically no attack surface, and can be hosted on free or inexpensive hosts like Github Pages .\nThis talk is focused on introducing a simple static site generator to beginners and even avid bloggers who aren't coders . This talk will cover:-   Basic installation of Pelican  Writing a blog post with Pelican  Changing themes of a blog/site  Comparison between Jekyll and Pelican    The main aim of this talk is to familiarize people with the concept of edifice . I have met a lot of non coders who have asked me about creating a basic website for personal use . This talk is also targeted to all those you are interested in blogging and everyone out there has something to say and something to blog ",

REST is easy to get started, loosely structured and does good job in exchanging messages. But it's convenience comes with a performance trade-off, which takes us back to other optimal alternative: gRPC  Description  In this talk we will see what gRPC is and how it is different from REST. We will get started with GRPC by generating stubs for python and \nbuild a simple gRPC API server. We will try to find out the advantages of gRPC over REST by doing a side by side comparison of our APIs. We then deploy our server in Kubernetes and discuss how we could scale our microservices.

    "Description": "Abstract  Ever wonder creating your own super-type-manager leveraging the python's own type constructs?  Ever explored alternatives to APIs for integration?  In this talk, we will cover our experience in building a new type manager (as part of developing open source OpenManage(tm) Software Development Kit) leveraging pythons own type constructs and explore how this new type manager provides a credible alternative to APIs, especially in those information-heavy environments  like Device Management.  Description  Devices (like Servers, Switches, Telecom Switches) are data-intensive systems. Their information model is so intensive, that practically all operations (health, inventory, metrics, configuration) on the device ends up in primarily as CRUD operations on the information model they expose.  Only a paltry few operations are exposed as APIs.  When building an API for managing these devices, we realized that providing classic function-style APIs only degraded the user experience. What we realized was there was significant information available on the Servers, and providing an API for exposing traditional CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) for all information nuggets was just exploding the API sets.  It was not necessarily covering all the scenarios that could be possible for management and did not seem to scale.  Our approach was to take this information model within the devices and expose them as a huge navigable data structure representing the entire spectrum of the device and provide a language native experience. We created a new type manager leveraging the python class special operators ( getattr (), setattr (), le () etc.) to create a whole new type manager that provides additional controls and safeguards.  Some of the safeguards include:   Not allowing edits to read-only components  Allowing only applicable changes only (ranges, enumerations)  Providing native python experience for special types (IP Address Types etc.)  Providing mechanisms to validate cross-attribute validations  Providing custom indices for arrays (like Virtual Disks, Users)  Providing mechanism for tracking changes to configuration  Apply changes to the device optimally  Provide mechanisms for identifying configuration drifts   Outline :  Outline of the presentation:   Introduction  Device Configuration - Aspects & Peculiarities  Pitfalls of API approach for Device Configuration  Type Manager - introduction  Super Types - Enumerations, Fields, Classes and Arrays  Bringing in Native Type Experience  Data as API - Enriched user experience  Demo  Q&A   Key takeways to audience  Audience will get an exposure:   How to create your own type manager by overloading python type constructs  Exposure to alternative approach to creating APIs for data-heavy systems & explore benefits  Learn how type manager simplifies your life as well as the life of your consumers.  Secrets of the python inbuilt __ operators - and how you can leverage them to provide native type experience even for your own custom classes  How you can create a better user experience for customers in a simple way  How you can incorporate Object Oriented SOLID principles",

    "Description": "Fog and haze (referred to as the atmospheric light) are the main cause of distortions, degradation in the quality of images clicked during foggy situations. But with the advancement in technology, thanks to Python and OpenCV libraries and brilliant minds of people out here in this small world, recovering almost a fog-free image has been made possible in recent times. And now we are moving towards making this algorithm more optimized so that it can work in real time for videos and live camera feed. Different mathematical models have been presented over the time for this algorithm but there are very few real-life implementations in any particular programming language, so here the Python implementation of this algorithm will be discussed. Basic steps and the ideas implemented will be discussed in a brief and different implementation will also be shown in the session",

    "Description": "Everyday we listen to this word \"DATA\".\nBut after listening to that word, some questions might pop up in your mind.  WHAT IS DATA?  WHY DOES ANYONE NEED TO WORK WITH DATA?  HOW TO UTILISE AND WORK WITH THIS DATA?  Data is now one of the most important things for any business to run. From small startups to large companies, everyone looks at data to improve their business.\nEveryone looks at data to increase their profits. Everyone looks at data to understand why they failed and where they failed. Everyone looks at data to understand how a product gained success in the market. Basically Data is everything today for companies.  Data is available everywhere now and it's become more important than ever to actually work with data and luckily we have great modules to work with data in Python. I'll be focusing on these modules and the power that data possesses.  My primary focus here would be about the power of data. I surely will be talking about how to use this data in Python to make the most out of it, but before that I'd like the entire crowd to know what the power of data is.  This would be a good talk for beginners honestly. Even if you have no idea about how data could be used or what is data, after this talk, you'll get a decent idea about it. Through this talk the 3 questions mentioned above in bold will be answered.  The talk would progress in the following manner :   Self introduction (3 minutes)  Introduction about the topic (2 minutes)  What is data? (3 minutes)  Where is this data? (2 minutes)  How to make the most out of data? (3 minutes)  How Python helps in this process? (2 mins)  Name and explain about different Python modules like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn in brief (10 mins)",

    "Description": " It is always essential to understand the genesis of evolution or the roots of revolution.   Keeping in mind the above saying, in this workshop, I will provide a hands-on understanding of Blockchain technology using Python. There are multiple resources to get a firm understanding about this domain, but the best way to understand it is by using the concept of \"Learning-By-Doing\" .   Following are few reasons why I want to willingly contribute to this domain:    Blockchain is the underlying technology behind most of the\n   cryptocurrencies and it has a potential of changing the way we work\n   and communicate, making it more secure, efficient, and trustworthy.    There is a immense amount of speculation going around in this domain\n   with the rise of Bitcoin.  What\u2019s happening with blockchain\n   technology, I would say, is similar to the great American gold rush\n   that happened in the mid 1800s.    Innovators, investors, entrepreneurs, technologists all are hovering\n   over the same underlying idea on how these cryptocurrencies work and\n   how could blockchain be leveraged to create use-cases beyond\n   crypto-systems.     Also, I would love to mention few quotes to support the escalating phenomenon of Blockchain :   The blockchain cannot be described just as a revolution.  It is a tsunami-like phenomenon, slowly advancing and gradually enveloping\neverything along its way by the force of its progression. -- William\nMougayar  Over the next decade, there will be disruption as significant as the Internet was for publishing, where blockchain is going to disrupt\ndozens of industries, one being capital markets and Wall Street. -- Patrick M. Byrne    I will help people in understanding the bits and bytes of this domain, including the basic cryptography concepts, algorithms and how to utilize the power of Python language to build their own blockchain. As we progress, we would engage into more advanced concepts pertaining to scalability and deployment once we build a minimalist prototype of aforementioned.  Using on-the-go learning while developing will serve as a pivotal entry point for all the people who are willing to enter into this space and planning to  build smart-contracts or invest in cryptocurrencies.   Agenda for workshop :   Introduction to Blockchain:  Existing problems, what is Blockchain, why it matters, gist of few use-cases, related concepts.  Python revisited:  Functions, libraries, object-oriented programming terminologies, basic data structures, basics of zen of python.  Blockchain under the hood: Cryptography 101, underlying data structure and algorithms, conceptual terminologies.  Python and Blockchain amalgamated: Create blockchain using python.  User-friendly front-end: Integrating the scripts in previous section with a basic front-end.  Discussion regarding scalability methods and resources.  Generating self-help focused Pypi library called pymyblockchain . (optional)  Q&A session.   Note: The above agenda is subject to change. It is tentative for now.

It becomes really tedious for a person to go and visit all the sources to obtain information. It could be of great help to the person if there can be a single source which cumulatively providing all the links of news generated by different newspapers. This is where web scraping and automation comes into picture.  In this talk I want to explain how to scrape webpages hassle free , gather information and represent the gathered content in a easy to visualize format. By executing just a single Python file we can get all the data what we want from the web. Its not just about collecting the data, it is to reduce the repetitive work which a person does again and again to achieve the same goal. We can put repetitive work into a module and leave it upon the computer to do the same. This in turn will help us channelize our time more on the information rather than gathering that information.

    "Description": "What is Transfer Learning?  Transfer Learning is the method of reusing our existing knowledge developed for one task to solve a similar task. Say, you want to detect cars on night-time images and instead of learning from scratch we could reuse our existing knowledge from a model which has been trained on day-time images. Transfer learning allows us to deal with these scenarios by leveraging the already existing labeled data of some related task or domain.  I believe Transfer Learning is a major achievement in our quest for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as Transfer Learning allows us to generalize our knowledge which is something we humans excel at.   Andrew Ng, ex-chief scientist at Baidu, co-founder of Coursera and professor at Stanford, said during his widely popular NIPS 2016 tutorial,   \u201cTransfer Learning will be the next driver of ML success.\u201d   Training Deep Neural Networks from scratch is an expensive process. Not only does it require a lot of compute resources and time, deep Learning models require a huge amount of data and it is a major bottleneck when it comes to start-ups and niche areas of research like health care.  What you will learn :-   How to build an image classifier in a few minutes using Transfer Learning  When and how to fine-tune pretrained models  Freezing layers of a pretrained model depending upon the scenario  Using ConvNet as a    feature extractor  Using differential learning rates  Constraints of using pretrained models   Transfer Learning : Beyond Computer Vision  Cross-Lingual Domain Adaptation : Using the knowledge we have learnt from one language and applying our knowledge to another language is another application of transfer learning with huge potential. Cross-lingual adaptation methods would allow us to leverage the vast amounts of labeled data we have in English and apply them to any language, particularly languages with very less labeled data such as Indian languages.  Reinforcement Learning and Learning from Simulations : Training an agent (in Reinforcement Learning) to achieve general artificial intelligence directly in the real world is too costly and hinders learning initially through unnecessary complexity. It is better to train an agent in a simulated environment such as the OpenAI Gym before deploying it in the real world. Eg: Self-driving cars  Agenda  1.Introduction to Computer Vision (3 min)  2.Introduction to Transfer Learning (3 min)  3.Why should you use Transfer Learning?

    "Description": "In this talk, I will speak about a simple yet very powerful image manipulation mechanism.   The naive user utilizes the services of any standard toolkit, be it a web service or a remote application for image manipulation. The black box approach to this process is: A user provides an image and other parameters as input to the toolkit which in turn produces the results and returns it back to the user. Often these results are not up to the mark. The image sometimes gets distorted, misaligned or blurred.  Deviating from the standard mechanisms, I would like to talk about a technique called as Content aware image resizing . The primary factor in this technique is the content . It is the content which drives the entire technique. The image is cropped, enlarged or modified keeping in mind the primary factor.  I will talk about an algorithm called as Seam Carving which is used under the hood to achieve the aforementioned technique. It is this algorithm and the power of Python libraries , that makes this technique perform better than the standard mechanisms.   Agenda of Talk:   Introduction: Basics of seam carving, how the algorithm works  Understanding energy concepts, basics of computer vision and dynamic programming  Walk over the pseudo-code and dry run of algorithm  Comparative analysis of this technique with standard mechanisms  Q&A Session  Conclusion",

In this hands on talk we will see how this is possible with the latest deep learning techniques combined with word embeddings and other advanced NLP technique.   In this talk, first we would introduce two neural network and machine learning mechanisms which in popular and widely used in NLP (natural language processing): Word Embeddings and Recurrent Neural Network. Word Embeddings is a way to extract the context of a word by \u201clearning\u201d its presence in a paragraph; while Recurrent Neural Network, including LSTM (long short-term-memory), enable us to \u201ctrain\u201d sequential data. After that, we will showcase how to implement these mechanisms in a neutral network. With that, we can \u201cbuild\u201d a machine to generate articles, plays or speeches in the style of the training corpus and have lots of fun.  In the first half of the talk, concepts of how Word Embeddings and LSTM works will be explained. Audiences will understand why this is essential in the field of NLP and why we are using it. In the second half, a code demo will be used to showcase how to implement these mechanisms. Through an example, audiences will learn how Keras is used together with Tensorflow and Python to build a sequential neutral network. We will showcase generating a paragraph using Shakespeare\u2019s play and another one using Trump\u2019s speech.  This talk is for people who have some experience with data science and understand the concept of how a neural network works, but would like to go deeper into the details of how does it applied to NLP to solve more complex AI problems. We used very simple code but did a complex task like text generation, that opens the door for a lot of people who wants to experiment with deep learning",

With Docker and Terraform, we can create the same environment on cloud easily. For example, we will deploy a Jupyter notebook on Google Cloud Platform using both tools.   In this talk, we will use a task: hiring a GPU on Google Cloud Platform to train neural network, as an example to show how an application can be deployed on a cloud platform with Docker and Terraform. The goal is to have Jupyter Notebook running in an environment with Tensorflow (GPU version) and other libraries installed on a Google Compute Engine.  First we will briefly explain what is Docker and what is Terraform for audiences who has no experience in either or both of them. Some basic concepts of both tools will also be covered. After that, we will walk-through each steps of the work flow, which includes designing and building a Docker image, setting up a pipeline on Github and Docker Hub, writing the Terrafrom code and the start up script, launching an instance. From that, audiences will have an idea of how both tools can be use together to deploy an app onto a cloud platform and what advantages each tool can bring in the process.  This talk is for people with no experience in application deployment on cloud service but would benefit form computational reproducibility and cloud service, potentially data scientists/ analysts or tech practitioners who didn\u2019t have a software developing background. We will use an example that is simple but useful in data science to demonstrate basic usage of Docker and Terraform which would be beneficial to beginners who would like to simplify their work flow with those tools",

    "Description": "Ever encounter a tricky situation of knowing there\u2019s names that are the same, but matching strings straight away leads you no where? All you need is FuzzyWuzzy, a simple but powerful open-source Python library and some wit. This talk will demonstrate how to efficiently fuzzy match company names.   Matching strings should be one of the first natural language processing problem that human encounter since we start use computer to handle data. Unlike numerical value which has an exact logic to compare them, it is very hard to say how alike two strings are for a computer. One may compare them character by character and have an idea of how many characters in the pair of stings are the same. Unfortunately in most application we need computer to perceive strings like we do and therefore we have to use fuzzy matching. Fuzzy matching on names is never straight forward though, the definition of how \u201cdifference\u201d of two names are really depends case by case. For example with restaurant names, matching of words like \u201ccafe\u201d \u201cbar\u201d and \u201crestaurant\u201d are consider less valuable then matching of some other less common words. Also, do we consider company names that matches partly (like \u201cHappy Unicorn company\u201d and Happy Unicorn co.\u201d) are the same?  In the first half of the talk Levenshtein Distance, a measure of the similarity between two strings, will be explained. Different functions in FuzzyWuzzy like \u201cpartial_ratio\u201d and \u201ctoken_sort_ratio\u201d will also be explored and compared for difference. It is very important to understand our tool and choose the right one for our task. Then in the second half, we will start tackling the example problem: matching company names, we will show that besides using FuzzyWuzzy, we have to also handle problem like finding and avoid matching of common words and speeding up the matching process by grouping the names. By combining all tricks and techniques that we demonstrate, we will also evaluate how efficient this method is and the advantage of using this method.  This talk is for people in all level of Python experience who would like to learn a trick or two and would like to be able to solve similar problems in the future. Theory of how the library works will be explained and It is easy to be pick up even for beginners",

    "Description": "When you make a search for a hotel room, do you know how many travel agents are searching for you at the same time? In this talk, we demonstrate how to use the millions of searches a sourcing company received to build a network of travel agents and finding the main hubs among them using NetworkX.   Network analysis is getting more and more attention in Business Intelligence, people hope to get information out of the structure of an organization or a communication network. In this talk, we use the hotel room search requests from travel agents, including online public website, B2C, B2B and B2B2C, to build a relational network among them. By using this network as an example, we demonstrate how insights can be extract by studying network properties.  In the first half of the talk, we will explain how the network is built using NetworkX, an open-source python library that is designed for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. When 2 agents are making the same search at the same time , a link ( or an \u201cedge\u201d in network analysts terms) is made pointing form the initial searcher to the subsequent searcher. Using a list of these searches, a directed graph is built. We will also demonstrate how to pick the biggest connected component out form the graph. In the second half, with the graphs created, we show how different functions of NetworkX can be used to study the graphs. By compare the graph properties of our graph to the other popular network graphs, we can get the insight of how the network was created. Also by studying the graphs, we can understand the behavior of the agents and can even figure out which agents are acting as main hubs in the network.  This talk is for people who are interested in network analysis and would like to see how it can be used in a business case. Audiences with any level of python experience can learn some basic concept of network analysis work and how it can be applied to provide business insights",

But there\u2019s other models which could also break down a seasonal series into trend, seasonality and noise. We will use an open source Python library called Seasonal to analyse B2B worldwide travel data.   Times series analysis is an important part of data analysis for lots of businesses. It is very often for stakeholders to be interested in the performance of the business by analyzing measurements of profit, cost, number of sale, number of searches etc over time. In this talk, we will do a case study of showing how we estimate the impact public holidays made on the travel business. The method of analyzing the time series by seasonal breakdown will be explored and the work flow of solving the problem will be explained.  In the first half of the talk, an introduction about time series and its characteristic will be explained for audiences who is new to analysis on time series. The data we use will be from a business to business travel company. It has seasonality thought out the year, a weekly cycle and also a growing trend in business. As the company have clients around the world, data from different countries will shows different behaviors as well. Therefore, before we show the analysis, the complexity of the data will be explored. In the second half, we will introduce a open source Python library called Seasonal. Using this package, we will demonstrate how to break down the travel data and extract the fluctuation of the sale in different countries. By comparing the fluctuation and Google calendar, public holidays in different countries can be spotted and their impact on the business can be estimated.  This talk is for people who are interested in time series analysis and its application in business. Audiences with or without experience would also found this talk useful in giving them insights in how a business could benefit in making use of the data and doing a proper time series analysis",

There is a speciality with ANTLRv4, we can separate context from the grammar (so we can get very close to the expectation that grammars are context free).  I expect the session to be beginner friendly so no pre-requisites save some basic python expected. Also I will cover some basic examples, and also a demo of an actual language grammar to create a meta-program if time permits. The session is expected to have the following things:   What is a grammar ?  What are Parse trees and how do they compare to ASTs ?  What is ANTLR ? (The parser generator and the runtime provided)  How do we use a parse tree ?

This allows to create Generic Consoles and loosely coupled clients. The main objective of this talk is to provide an overview of Hydra and Hydrus and how we can create such APIs using Hydrus.  Hydra  Building Web APIs seems still more an art than a science. How can we build APIs such that generic clients can easily use them? And how do we build those clients? Current APIs heavily rely on out-of-band information such as human-readable documentation and API-specific SDKs. However, this only allows for very simple and brittle clients that are hardcoded against specific APIs. Hydra, in contrast, is a set of technologies that allow us to design APIs in a different manner, in a way that enables smarter clients.  Hydrus  Hydrus is a Flask server meant to build and deploy Hydra-based Web APIs in a straightforward and effective way. Hydrus utilises the power of Linked Data to create a powerful REST APIs to serve data. Hydrus uses the Hydra draft standard for creation and documentation of it's APIs.

    "Description": "Note: This talk is co-presented by Koushik (me) and Shubham Rao  Talk Summary:  Bitcoin has become so mainstream these days. It unveiled the importance of decentralization. But how does Bitcoin work? It\u2019s because of its core technology called Blockchain. After the Internet, Blockchain technology is regarded as the next big revolution. This talk gives a hands-on demonstration of how Blockchain technology works by building a toy version from scratch.  Outcomes:  After this talk the audience should be able to understand the basic working principles of bitcoin. They will be able to leverage their knowledge as a starting point of open-source contributions to projects like Ethereum.   This demonstration will consider three important features of Blockchain Technology. All these features are essential to blockchain technology and we will be building a minimal version in Python.  Agenda:  0 - 5 mins:\n    Blockchains are secure because they use SHA256 or SHA512 algorithm for cryptography. I will describe the logic behind these hashing algorithms and give some computational facts about them.  5 - 10 mins: \n    I will use the Python library called \u2018hashlib\u2019 to implement the SHA256 algorithm in Python. This makes us to convert data into SHA256 hashes.  10 - 15 mins:\n    The SHA256 algorithm is used to convert all the transactions and their details into a single hash. Once the everything is converted into a hash, this hash must be stored for future usage. After a new transaction is approved, this new transaction and its details are again converted into a new hash along with the previous hash. I will demonstrate the process of storing the hash and using it again for a new transaction.  15 - 20 mins:\n    Here I will explain a basic working principle of blockchains and how linking the previous transactions with the new one helps in the their security.  The hashes stored are called blocks and the process of liking the previous hash the new hash makes a chain like connection thus forming a Hyperledger.  20 - 25 mins:\n  Later in the process of mining will be explained using the variable quantity called Nonce. This explains why bitcoin miners need high computation power to do Proof-of-Work. \nI will also cover a variety of essential terms and concepts through the course of the talk which haven\u2019t been detailed in the agenda. Also, I will use python module called 'TkInter' to build a basic GUI for our blockchain.  Last 5 mins:\n    Questions and further reading + code sharin",

    "Description": "In this talk, I am going to talk about advanced concepts of Python related to Caching.   A cache can be easily understood as a saved answer to a question. Caching can speed up an application if a computationally complex question is asked frequently. Instead of the computing the answer over and over, we can use the previously cached answer.  Caching is an important component while scaling applications which are to be used by many users. It solves various problems related to cost and latency. Usually it takes more time to retrieve data from DB rather than cache. Using a cache to avoid recomputing data or accessing a slow database provides us with a great performance boost.  I will describe in depth the different methods of Caching, their pros and cons. This talk will help developers focus on their code before scaling their applications. It will provide immense performance improvements with this simple concept.  Outcomes: The novice audience will be able to understand basic Caching Mechanisms. They will be able to utiilize their knowledge which will serve pivotal while scaling applications   Contents to be covered in talk:    Local Caching: What is it, how to do it, example, built-in Python libraries: (using cachetools ), advantages, dis-advantages    Memoization: What is it, pseudo-code algorithm, implementation using example, built-in Python libraries: (using lru_cache ), advantages, dis-advantages    Distributed Caching: What is it, techniques: (using memcached , using pymemcache )     Agenda:   Initial 10 minutes: Introduction to Caching and its various techniques.  10 - 20 minutes: Examples and code walk through for various techniques.  20 - 25 minutes: Comparative analysis of how caching is better than non-scaled applications.  25 - 30 minutes: Q&A session",

    "Description": "Summary:   Knowing how Enterprise Server perform under load (% CPU, % Memory, Network,   % Disk time) is extremely valuable and critical. This may limit the server performance and lead to enhancements or fixing before you go for production. Now any Load testing tools available comes with below problems   Preparing the environment / infrastructure (installing various software dependencies) on multiple host systems to perform load test at times very tedious task.  It requires maintenance and manual interventions to scale up and scale down load test.  You have to write your own test codes, need some development effort.  Most of the stress tools comes with their own format of reporting, very difficult to customize if it\u2019s really needed. Also it\u2019s difficult to view, analyze and compare test results real time across systems.   Here in today\u2019s talk we are going to demonstrate how JAAS (JMeter As A Service) can be a one stop solution for all these problems. And how python is playing a crucial role in Delivering JAAS Solution.  Tech Stack:   Tech Stack behind JAAS   Python: Python is at the core of JAAS. It is responsible for communicating across all individual components using Rest API. Python is also responsible for slicing and dicing the data for processing.  Docker: For auto deploying of JMeter Apps, we use Docker containers (pre-packaged with all dependencies). This reduces manual interventions for maintaining the Load test environment / infrastructure.  ELKB Stack:  ELKB is the backend for JAAS. We store all logs, beats, JMeter results in Elastic Search. Logstash for data processing pipeline and Kibana for visualization.  JMeter : JMeter is the load test tool for generating load. It\u2019s an open source software, Ease of Use, Platform independent and Robust Reporting.     JAAS comes with a single window User interface where user will provide the Load test details like:   System details  Load Generation type  Number of concurrent users  Number of threads   Using RESTFul API implemented in Python this info (including dynamic Test plan .jmx file for JMeter) will be stored in ES Backend and a new Docker service will be created.  We use Docker container (prepackaged with all dependencies as a single app) for generating load on System. Usually a Docker container ships JMeter software and Beats (Data shippers for Elasticsearch ). Every time for a new load test request, we deploy a new instance of our app on the Docker Swarm cluster (a new Docker container).We maintain Docker swarm cluster (group of machines that are running Docker) for scalability and load balancing while performing load test. Each of this machines in cluster (both manager and worker) will communicate with each other and execute Docker command using Python Rest call only. Swarm managers can use several strategies to run Docker containers, such as \u201cemptiest node\u201d -- which fills the least utilized machines with containers. Or \u201cglobal\u201d, which ensures that each machine gets exactly one instance of the specified container.  Swarm managers authorize workers to execute\\run the Docker container. Each Docker service will have specific input from user (stored in ES backend) for generating particular type of load on specific host system. Similarly user can scale up or scale down the load (number of users or threads) using the same UI form on the fly. This is the biggest advantage of JAAS over any other Load test tool available. In normal scenario there is no option but stop and start the tool, if you want to scale up or down. \nEach Docker container with its JMeter instance will keep generating the Load on specific host system and Beats will be responsible for pushing back the data/results into Elasticsearch. This entire implementation of data reading and writing to Elasticsearch is happening through Python. Once the load test specific data pushed to Elasticsearch , kibana will prepare the Visualization for you. This is real time, aggregated (in case of concurrent users are generating the Load) and available in a single dashboard which makes it very easy to compare and analyze",

    "Description": "Data proliferation is putting pressures on business leaders to become data-driven. Although, leaders have to rely on data analysts to run those queries and get insights out from data warehouses. Its a common principle-agent problem wherein data analysts only ask questions from data which they are directed to ask, but its never a one-way street. One has to flirt with data for a long time to get to know it and leaders get stuck in the loop of data analyst direction as leaders are not equipped with or don't have time to write SQL queries.  This calls for a natural language query wherein a business leader can ask a question in simple plain English and data is spitting out either in a table or graph. This session is guided towards how Innovaccer has solved this problem and provides an architecture, knowledge base building, and natural language processing guidance to build one on your own. The session will also emphasize on the fact that accuracy of such a software will be very poor if it is industry agnostic as SalesForce and ThoughtSpot have tried in the past. Thus, one has to tame it to their own business context or vertical",

    "Description": "Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing.    It is focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling as well.  Although it is most popular in the web development ecosystem, it has a wide area of usage from system management to IoT devices. With Celery, transforming a function into a task is quite easy and can add great performance & usability to the applications that we build.  This talk aims to give attendants a general overview of Celery and its uses. We will walk through the core Celery architecture by introducing key components with the help of various real-world examples. This will also lead to an understanding of the task queue systems in general. Attendants will also gain knowledge about Celerybeat; a tool that focuses on scheduling tasks",

    "Description": "Django, as we all know, is an excellent framework for building high stable, scalable, extensible web apps. Django framework operates around middlewares. Do we really understand how a middleware works? What happens when the request comes in and response goes out? Which middleware is used for what purposes? Why is the order of middleware stack important? How can we implement a custom middleware? Benefits and complications of implementing custom middlewares  My talk will cover all the above questions along with a live demo of a profiling middleware ( customizable-django-profiler ) which is used to track down the function calls associated with an API call taking more time for execution.  Contents of the talk:   Introduction : Introduction to middleware.  Middleware architecture : I will talk about the middleware architectural design. It\u2019s basics and various use cases  Implementation of middleware in Django : Explain how the request-response cycle works along with targeting above mentioned questions on the go.  Live demo : I will demo the development of a simple custom middleware which can be used for profiling requests.  Conclusion : Possible use cases for Django middlewares.  Q & A session : Questions and answers session.   In the end, the audience will have an understanding of Django middleware stack, middleware architecture, request-response cycle in Django and will be able to develop their own middleware for Django from scratch",

    "Content URLs": "A similar version of this talk was recently delivered at Pycon APAC2018 (Singapore).   Video   An attendee's review", 
    "Description": "Offensive / abusive content is a major issue for social-media and digital interaction platforms. In some jurisdictions (Eg: Europe), platform providers are required by law to remove such content within 24 hours of posting or risk hefty fines (upto \u20ac50M in Germany). In order to meet the governance mandate, we need to have systems in place that can automatically detect abusive content at scale. This talk is based on my practical experience of building an automated solution to solve this problem.  This talk begins with discussing some of the approaches currently being employed for offensive content detection at scale: word filtering, rule-based systems and actual human annotation.  The former two are restricted by the following:   Offensive content is context specific. A given word (f*ck) can be used in both positive (that\u2019s f*cking awesome) and negative (that\u2019s f*cking terrible) contexts.  Robustness to spelling variations (The word \u2018shit\u2019 can be spelt as \u2018sh*t\u2019, \u2018sh!t\u2019, etc)  Failure to detect content that is offensive in idea but uses non-offensive words. (Eg: your mom is a fat cow, X people are inferior, etc)   Manual human annotation is notoriously hard and expensive to scale. The talk presents a Deep neural network based approach to overcome the previously mentioned limitations. It introduces and discusses the building blocks of model architecture (deep convolutional networks, word embeddings, etc).  The second half of the talk focuses on implementing the model to solve the problem at scale as a RESTful micro-service using python, Django, Tensorflow and Docker. This architecture can also be used to implement other text classification systems (eg: sentiment detection, user intent detection systems, topic-of-discussion classifiers, etc.), making the talk relevant for a wider user base.  Attendees will:   Gain insights into building deep learning based text-classification systems that can scale  Learn the nitty gritties of the offensive content detection and text classification  Learn about the basic concepts of Deep Learning and NLP (convolutional neural nets, multi-layer perceptron, word embeddings, etc.)  Understand the scientific and software challenges involved in text classification and learn to overcome them  Be able to apply the learnings from here to other text classification problems as well",

    "Description": "Your machine learning models might be intelligent enough to make predictions but may lack the wisdom to prevent bias. They may be as vulnerable as a child getting influenced by inappropriate sources encouraging racism, sexism or any unintended prejudice. Models learn exactly what they are taught. The more biased your data is, the more biased is your model.  For instance, a text model by Google says how \u201cEngineer is to a Man\u201d is the same as \u201cHousewife to a Woman\u201d. This shows how incidental data can lead to unintended bias. Machines are given the power to judge so there is a need for us to ensure we prevent biased/unfair judgments. In this talk, we are going to discuss how to arrive at \"Engineer is the same for both man and woman\" [debiasing gender] by following the steps below :  Intro to Machine Learning bias and word vectors?

But what if you know how the back-end of how these softwares run? what if you know the what kind of codes make your camera detect objects? Well with OpenCV and python its simpler than you can imagine!  My talk will be about OpenCV with Python. OpenCV is an acronym for Open Source Computer Vision Library . Its a library used for image processing. The code can be written in C++, Java or Python but since we all love Python, we'll use that. We will be using ' cv2 ' library for all the image processing and detection. My talk will feature:   How images are stored in computer and how each pixels store image.  Different types of Colour Bands and the role of Colour Bands in forming an image.  Editing images with cv2 library in python.  Blurring, Sharpening, Greyscaling, and other uses of image kernels.

    "Description": "Just like in our everyday lives, AI and robotics are increasingly a part of our healthcare ecosystem. Currently healthcare is broken; there\u2019s shortage of doctors; poor quality of care. There is a dire need to provide assistance to the whole medical industry to improve healthcare.  PyTorch, which is a very popular modular deep learning framework for fast, flexible experimentation is an invaluable resource for such problems. It supports seamless conversion of Numpy arrays into GPU tensors and vice versa. The dynamic computational graph allows to change the network behavior on the fly unlike static graphs and due to Its highly modular nature helps in fast debugging.  Unlike other production grade tools, Pytorch helps with lots of Research and Experimentation with novel architectures and is very useful to test ideas a bit more quickly and prototyping.  With Medical Imaging being the field most impacted by AI, our goal in this workshop is to give a good head start covering the heuristics of Medical Imaging, the concepts involved in it and how to code your way out.   This workshop would be divided into two halfs.    First Half: Pytorch Introduction\nDuration: 1 hour 20 minutes\nThe first half would be a gentle introduction to PyTorch framework. We will introduce the audience with the basics of PyTorch. This workshop will cover topics like:    What is PyTorch? (Use cases and war stories)   Tensor 101  Ndarray/Tensor library  Numpy Bridge,  Fast CPU to GPU conversion of tensors  The automatic differentiation engine or autograd  Difference between Static and Dynamic computational graphs  Advantages of dynamic computational graph with examples  The optimization package  Scope of debugging  Ecosystem  Linear Code flow in Pytorch (One of the core philosophy of PyTorch)  Saving and loading models*  Deep Learning workflows*  Tutorial on Transfer Learning.*  Workflows which involve writing custom data-loaders will also be introduced in brief.*    A 10 minute coffee/kit-kat break. :-)  Second Half: Let\u2019s dive in. Duration: 1 hour 15 minutes.   Introduction to Radiology: What is radiology? What do the images look like? How is AI used here? How will AI help improve radiology practice?  Liver, Tumor and Vessel Segmentation - setting the context of why it is needed.  Challenges faced in solving liver segmentation.  How we solved the challenges - edge maps, data imbalance  and overall architecture and data used. Hands on with live Liver Segmentation using PyTorch.  Challenges faced in vessel segmentation and classification.  How we solved the challenges - vesselness filters, overall architecture and data used. Hands on with live Vessel Segmentation using PyTorch.   Putting it all together  A 15 minutes Q & A session",

World\u2019s technology giants have placed big bets with their investments in services providing voice search, personal digital assistant, IoT devices etc. Solving the problem of speech recognition is a herculean task, given the complexity involved with data like the human voice.  The talk will cover a brief history of speech recognition algorithms, the challenges associated with building these systems and then explain how one can build advanced speech recognition system using the power of deep learning and for illustration, we will deep dive into Project DeepSpeech. Project DeepSpeech is an open source Speech-To-Text engine developed by Mozilla Research based on Baidu's Deep Speech research paper and implemented using Google's TensorFlow library.  Speech recognition is not all about the technology, there's a lot more concerns, challenges around how these AI models are being part of our day to day life , it's biases etc. The bigger question revolves around centralization of these AI services, projects like Common Voice addresses these problems by enabling all to be part of this revolution, a part of the talk will focus on how people need to approach these type of research keeping in mind the community and humanitarian benefits as first priority",

    "Description": "This Workshop is designed to guide developers who are interested in learning more about the basics of open source software and contributing to their first open source project. We'll look at Open Library, a mature open source project, and see how 20 open source contributors are able to make contributions which impact over a million international users. You\u2019ll learn what tools, best practices, and processes help make an open source project successful and what beginning steps you can take to enter the open source world.  What is Open Library?  Open Library is a non-profit online library created by Aaron Swartz and Brewster Kahle in 2006 with the mission of \u201cOne Web Page for every book ever published\u201d. Open Library is written in  Python using the web.py micro-framework, and is open source on Github. Open Library uses Infobase, its own database framework based on PostgreSQL and Infogami which is its own Wiki Engine using Python.  Why Open Library?  Open Library has an active, supportive community, newcomer-friendly issues, and mature documentation , which makes it a good candidate for engineers who are looking to contribute to their first open source project . Some of the advantages of having Open Library as your entry to the world of Open Source Software are as follows:   Open Library is very easy to install and has simple and straight-forward instructions.  Issues for Beginners are labelled as first-timer-issues on the repository to help beginners get over their fear of contributing to Open Source and making it a simple process for them.  Open Library has a community call every week in order to catch up the progress that each contributor is making.  There is a Slack channel where anyone can be invited to and GitHub issues for communication.  There is an updated Wiki which keeps getting updated as contributors contribute to the project.  All coding procedures followed by Open Library are documented in a CONTRIBUTING / Getting Started guide.   Some of the opportunities for new developers looking to get started to contributing to Open Library are as follows:   Open Library does poorly as compared to global standards (like a modern js build system) and this is a huge opportunity for people who want to contribute to Open Library.  it relies on a lot of custom code like Infogami and Infobase which are not well maintained anymore and are mostly in Python 2. So there is huge opportunity here in building a complete system while migrating to Python 3 while making sure you do retain the ease of the old code.   Session Plan   Creating a Github account and finding us on Github. Comment on the Slack Invite Issue to be added to the Open Library Slack Org. Understand how communication works on Open Library and getting familiar with using Github Issues and Slack for communication.  Introducing yourself to the Open Library Community on Slack and initiating to become an 'Open Library Librarian'. This stage also involves talking with the Open Library community and finding Issues that match your interest.  A simple and brief introduction to Git(clone, add, commit, push, pull) and Github (Fork, PRs, Issues).  Setting up the project on your local dev environment. Reading Documentation as this is an important part of learning to contribute to Open Source Software.  Using the Github Bug Tracker to find First Timer Issues to resolve and work on them.  Making your first commit as a Open Library Librarian and  submitting a Pull Request.  Getting your Pull Request Merged after following community guidelines. Understanding the review process followed at Open Library and making sure to use that effectively to contribute to further Issues!",

    "Description": "This tutorial is meant to familiarize participants with Tensorflow, generally as a tensor library and particularly as a tool for doing day-to-day machine learning tasks. The ultimate goal of the tutorial is to be able to make participants comfortable enough with it so that they can use tensorflow as a scalable substitute for other ML libraries like sklearn.  Why Learn Tensorflow?  For the same reason that you should learn NumPy. Tensorflow is to Keras (and many other deep learning libraries) what NumPy is to sklearn (and many other machine learning libraries). It is the underlying data model of many deep learning applications. There are always nooks and crannies in any deep learning application that high level wrapper libraries cannot reach. The tutorial is aimed at making these accessible and debuggable with tensorflow.  What will I learn?  The focus of the tutorial would be on loss functions - ensuring their fundamental correctness with respect to the machine learning problem at hand, ensuring their differentiability and convergence are critical to solving a deep learning problem. There are many ready-made loss functions in tensorflow, and using these as building blocks, we will see how to make arbitrarily complex loss functions.  FAQs:   Q. Will I need a GPU?  A. No. The beauty of tensorflow is that it can seamlessly deploy code to GPUs, without you needing a GPU to develop that code.   Q. What is the format of the tutorial?  A. Being a tutorial, this session is meant to be highly interactive in nature. It will be a sequence of units where concepts are first explained and then the audience will have to solve exercises in a Jupyter notebook.   Q. I don't know anything about neural networks or deep learning. Should I attend this tutorial?  A. Absolutely. The focus is on tensors, which are the domain of tensorflow, and not on network layers, which are domain of keras",

But as the codebase scales, so does the difficulty in managing it. And as the applicability scales up, so does the difficulty in maintaining performance.  In this workshop, we will walk through how these problems crop up in the first place, and how to tackle them. This workshop will NOT cover scalability from the perspective of distributing data loading and computation across multiple compute units (horizontal scalability). We will focus more on how to write code from the very start that is both efficient in performance and makes a larger codebase manageable.  The topics we will go through are:  1.Performance - How should one write \"fast\" code   Finding the bottleneck - Profiling  Compiling Python to C - JIT vs AOT / Cython vs Numba vs Pythran vs PyPy - How they differ and choosing which one is for you  Concurrency - To parallelize or not to parallelize, to sync or not to sync  Choosing the right data structures  Hacks and bits that can get us the extra performance   2.Design Principles - How should one write \"good\" code, because we have all written code that we have difficulty in understanding ourselves in no time   Logging - Keeping track of what happened when and where  Type Checking - The why and the how  Unit Tests and beyond",

In the modern era of hybrid cores and processors, there is an in demand need for concurrent and parallel programming paradigms. Python, since its inception has amazing support for single threaded applications. The extensive use of Python in booming fields like Machine Learning has paved the way to constantly improve multi-threaded applications in Python.  I will speak from ground level covering very crucial aspects of Threading and Locks which will provide a better roadmap for community to develop better Python applications.  Program outcomes:   How threading can improve performance, its pros and cons.  What works best in which environment between threads and processes.  Why GIL matters the most in Python  How to leverage the power of open source source code to understand the crux of language.   Contents to be covered:  1. Threading for noobs:   Terminologies: Process, threads, multithreading, multiprocessing, types of threads, locks, mutex, CPU and I/O bound processes.

    "Description": "There lies a huge gap between a website made as a hobby/college project and that made for professional purposes. The journey to cross this is marked through database optimizations, consistent look and feel, efficient cache layer and many other things! Before delving into the open source world, my code screamed that it's owned by a college kid. But things changed once I interned with Wikimedia (under the Outreachy program). I want to share this very experience with my audience that how some gotchas and design decisions can bring about this transition. In this talk, I'll touch upon some of these areas that mainly deal with backend and database. My talk will summarize my learning from using Django in an application built for Wikipedia and is capable of handling huge amount of Wikipedia's data. To give a bit of background - I built this application for Wikipedia under Outreachy Round 15 (https://www.outreachy.org/). The app summarizes the contributions of the Wikipedia editors and presents it in a CV-like format. The biggest development challenge was dealing with millions of edits and doing all the related computations within seconds. Without any kind of optimizations, the webpage took 3 hours to load. Through my talk, I want to bring out the journey from 3 hours to 3 seconds on the table! Broad outline of my talk is as follows:   Why Django : It's very important to understand why and when to use Django. Majorly I'll be touching upon the scalability aspect and how it's a full package when it comes to web development.  Reducing the response time : When one is dealing with a database as huge as that of Wikipedia's, response time becomes of paramount importance. Optimizations like implementing a cache layer , using cron jobs , sessions etc will be discussed. Also, design choices will be compared - like cache layer using database vs sessions in python.  Database Optimizations : In this I'll be covering how database choice and query optimizations can affect the performance when dealing with large datasets. Hope you will find this talk interesting. :)",

    "Description": "The workshop will walk the audience on how to implement a state of the art object detector (YOLO: You only look once) from scratch using the PyTorch deep learning framework.  The main The aim is not to merely show the audience how to implement the detector that can work on videos, but give them a deep insight about the problems that rear their heads only when one is implementing a deep architecture. Some of these issues include,    Rapid Prototyping with PyTorch : Which PyTorch classes and abstractions to use to quickly code up neural network. How to implement a layer if it doesn't already ship with PyTorch. Our detector has 3 such layers!    How to deal with complex architectures efficiently : What if your network has more than a 100 layers? Our detector certainly has 106 ! Do we write 106 lines of code for each layer? What if we want to run our detector over a folder containing 100000 images that we can't fit into our RAM at once. Best PyTorch practices to get around problems like these will be discussed.    Speeding up Python code with Vectorisation : Python can be a slow language, but PyTorch does provide a lot of functions that are merely wrappers for super fast C code under the hood. Vectorisation and broadcasting will be covered in great detail. Using vectorised code instead of loops to do iterative tasks can give speed ups as much as 100x. Our detector can not work in real time without these optimisations.    Managing GPU resources : How to write device-agnostic code, parallelize GPU/CPU ops, practices to reduce redundant GPU memory usage, and how to time GPU code.      We will review the entire code base, and spend much time on justifying design decisions. A lot of non-critical code will be provided as it is to the audience, while they are expected to code along when it comes to the critical parts. These parts would be discussed in greater detail.  Important PyTorch features might also be demonstrated using toy examples outside the detector code base, which the audience is also expected to code along.  A docker image as well as Jupyter notebook will be provided to the audience. Google Colab may also be considered with notebooks provided.  Most of the tutorials online demonstrate how to write code that is more proof-of-concept rather than being performant. When it comes to learning to code complex architectures, especially when we are transitioning from beginner to intermediate stage, most of us have to rely on the laborious process of reading open source code. The idea of this workshop is to help audience move along this journey",

    "Description": "Sarcasm is an intensive, indirect and complex construct that is often intended to express contempt or ridicule. But in speech, it is multi-modal, involving tone, body language, and gestures along with linguistic artifacts used in speech. Sarcasm in the text , on the other hand, is more restrictive when it comes to such non-linguistic modalities. This makes recognizing textual sarcasm more challenging for both humans and machines.  Sarcasm detection plays an indispensable role in applications like online review summarizers, dialog systems, recommendation systems and sentiment analyzer . This makes automatic detection of it an important problem. However, it has been quite difficult to solve such a problem with traditional NLP tools and techniques .  So we will talk about the ongoing research and techniques developed to counter these problems. I have been trying to solve this problem for a while now so let's discuss it and hope that we solve it in the near future. Some of this techniques include tracking physiological gestures like eye tracking, extraction of psychological triggers or building a sarcasm dataset with the help of context features ",

    "Description": "About a month ago my inbox was flooded with emails beginning with We have decided to update our Terms and Conditions... . Though I am a technical person working in a financial services company and thus terms and conditions are supposed to be my cup of tea, I couldn't get myself to go through any of the actual Terms and Conditions .  A python based Natural Language Processing Engine to summarize the often twisted contents of a legal agreement and defining the pros and cons for the agreement in question for the user would better equip an user to understand what exactly they are agreeing to. This is very important in today's age where we've seen our personal data being breached for the benefit of social media based companies who then sell this data to achieve gains that could be political too. In the financial and legal world such documents are of utmost importance.  The process of developing a solution like this would be about defining the Gives and Takes of an agreement. Every agreement consists primarily of the things that a user is expected to receive from the other party/user and vice versa. The next step would be quantifying that particular give or take. This would give the user an estimate of what he/she would be expected to give/spend. Comparing that with the takes would help the user make a decision as to whether to agree with the terms and conditions or not. The quantifying system could consist of a number of attributes and the \"twisted ones\" or the ones affecting the user's privacy or other sensitive aspects cold be flagged appropriately so that the user can review and choose.  This talk would talk about the steps, right from defining legal contexts to setting up the words, phrases and understandings for typically legal content",

    "Description": "Machine Intelligence algorithms, in their application to real world problems, are largely models trained in a supervised manner. Hence, they are hindered by the reality that in most practical situations unlabelled data is easier to come across and obtaining appropriately annotated and labelled data may be prohibitively expensive. Herein lies the appeal of semi-supervised learning algorithms that allow us to draw inferences with only a few labelled data samples existing among a vast amount of unlabelled data. In this talk. through the application of a variation of the tried and tested SVM, called the S3VM(Semi Supervised SVM) on standard dense and sparse data sets, we will explore the merits and demerits of semi-supervised learning.  We will also take a cursory look at a few approaches used to solve the modified optimisation problem that arises when we adapt the SVM for use in a semi-supervised setting.  The outline of the talk will broadly be the following:   Why Semi-Supervised Learning  Advantages of using Semi-Supervised algorithms rather than Supervised algorithms on limited data  Approaches to Semi-Supervised Learning: Transduction vs Induction+Deduction  Modifying the SVM for Semi-Supervised Learning  Approaches for solving the modified SVM: Label-switching vs deterministic annealing  Semi-Supervised Learning is not a silver bullet: Discussion of disadvantages",

    "Description": "Nearest Neighbour(NN) algorithm, which is a lazy and a non-parametric method used for classification is one of the most intuitive and widely used machine learning algorithms. It is most often sought by business consultants for its simple and easy to understand framework. The performance of the algorithm can be enhanced by optimally tuning its hyper-parameters, which includes the k-value and the distance metric. However, practitioners tend to focus only on optimising k and ignores the other. The very term \"nearest-neighbour\" means that we employ some notion of near, i.e. we use some distance metric to quantify similarity and thus define neighbours. This emphasises the importance of the Distance Metric in the NN algorithm. In this talk, we present some of the novel approaches used, to learn the distance metric from the training data. Also, we demonstrate how slight amendments to the approach can lead to an inception of a dimensionality reduction technique. The above mentioned approaches are bundled together as a python package and is showcased to the audience.  Structure of the Talk:  1. An overview of K-NN algorithm\n2.

Key Takeaways from the talk:   Why we decided to build our own machine learning platfrom from scratch  How to build machine learning platform using python  Lessons Learned while building machine learning services  How to extend this platform by distributed computation engine like Spark and deep learning platform like tensorflow", 
    "Description": "Abstract  The purpose of this talk is to describe how helpshift has leveraged python ecosystem to build a machine learning platform without using any third party framework, and how you can build one too.  In particular, You can learn how to build the following components of machine learning platform using python from this talk.    How we use python celery framework to distribute model building tasks\n   to celery workers    How models heavier in size can be served to prediction node in real time    How to monitor model building tasks on celery worker    Python data science stack in Helpshift - Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, etc  Python libraries/framework used - Celery, S3/Azure Storage,  Bottle, etc  Description  Helpshift provides customer service platform to around 2000+ companies across various business domains like gaming, e-commerce, IoT, banking, entertainment, travel, hospitality, productivity apps and many more. Helpshift provides a suite of ML features that include auto ticket classification, FAQ suggestions to user query and other features. As each company using our platform has a different business domain, we build separate ML models for each of our customer and for each of feature.  To handle thousands of models and CRUD operations on them in production, we needed highly scalable and reliable machine learning platform for model building and serving models. Possible solution was to use Spark or Tensorflow for model building. But these frameworks did not provide facility to store thousands of models, and serve those for prediction in production. We decided to use celery framework for distributing model building tasks to celery workers and use core python data science libraries to build models.  Model building using celery worker  Each Celery worker in ML platform is registered to one or more model building queues. Each type of task is associated with one celery queue. In real time, the backend server submits model building task to pre-defined celery queue. One of available celery worker picks the pending task, builds the model and pushes it to blob storage like s3/azure with new model version.  Model management in s3/azure  We have written python wrapper around s3/azure client library to provide all required CRUD operation on models in s3. CRUD operations are simple operations like get_model, put_model, update_model with some version.  Serving models to prediction Nodes  Model size ranges from 5 - 25 mb. To do predictions within 30 ms, we have to either load all models in memory or store them on local disk of each prediction nodes. We decided to store all the models on local disk as loading them in memory was not a scalable approach. The challenge here is, whenever a particular model is updated, it has to be copied on each prediction node. A python service on the prediction node takes care of syncing updated model from s3 to local disk.  Prediction service  Prediction service is gunicorn server which fetches model from local disk and does prediction on incoming requests.  Monitoring model building task running on celery worker  As there are always some jobs in celery queue waiting for celery worker, we built active monitoring service which tracks the status of each submitted task. Monitoring service decodes metrics from celery worker to find failure of task and time spent by each task in waiting/running state. For any task that crosses the threshold time for wait or run state, an alert is sent",

Currently the count sit at 3 billion people, so there is a lot of capacity for data overload in the coming days  SQL is the world's easiest and most used programming language. The reason it is most used is because of its simplicity and power   What I want to propose is a tool that will help analysts directly use SQL on text data. This will be more than just applying NLTK functions on the SQL text. It will involve the following components   Data Structures ( similar to RDBMS etc)  Parsing  Ability to join etc   Advantages   The entire world of text data will be open for people with basic SQL skills to analyse.

    "Description": "Web crawling is hard. Large scale web crawling - which involves crawling millions of web pages in a month across 500 to 1000 websites, is even harder.  Python comes with a number of libraries which allow you to do such crawling-at-scale but a lot of real-world issues have to be tackled to get the crawling infrastructure right Some of which are,   Crawl rates - You need to strike the right balance here to make sure you don't crawl too aggressively but at the same time don't crawl too slow that the crawl finishes too late.  Right Data - You need to make sure you crawl the right parts of the websites to get the right data you want.  Dont get blocked! - Crawling from the same set of IP addresses will get you blocked across most modern websites. One needs some kind of rotating web proxy infrastructure to make sure that crawls can continue without getting kicked out.  Capturing Errors - How to capture crawling errors so you can detect most issues and surface them up, while doing distributed crawling.   Having nearly a decade of experience writing custom web-crawlers, the speakers have developed a set of custom tools to make crawling easy and painless. One of this is a tool to create a set of rotating web proxy caching nodes which use Squid and frontend by a HTTP load-balancer. The other one is a distributed crawler which uses Django as the middleware to distribute crawling across multiple crawler nodes while managing crawls at one place.  In this talk, the author(s) discuss about one such tool they have created and have successfully used in multiple businesses and software companies over the last 3 years. The tool allows one to quickly and cheaply create an infrastructure of custom web proxy nodes which supports multiple VPS backends. Using this tool one can rune an industrial strength web crawling infrastructure with a set of rotating proxies of up to 50 nodes with a monthly cost of just under 300 $.  The authors will talk about their experience and background creating and using the tool over the years, how it works with any web-crawler and the open source nature of the code which allows it to support different infrastructure backends and also the Squid configuration for the nodes which allows to hide the IP addresses behind the crawler.  The other tool is a distrubuted web crawling monitor and management tool which uses Django to schedule and manage crawls across multiple nodes via Redis and simple HTTP APIs with the crawls performed via Scrapy derived crawlers",

    "Description": "During my M.Tech. programme at IIT Guwahati, I observed that researchers in both industry and academia work with testbeds , both real and virtual, for making advancements in Computer Science , whether it is in algorithms, networking protocols or data science by running exhaustive experiments. I realised that Python, being a very versatile language , can be used to do everything related to experimental research and analysis , without requiring the usage of any other scripting language. Based on my experiences, I am presenting a talk to explain how to build automated testbed experiments, data collection and analysis with Python and a few libraries, avoiding big and bulky frameworks as much as possible .  My talk is structured as follows:   Building a testbed for computing and networking experiments  Using Python and paramiko to provison entities (PCs, smartphones, Raspberry Pis, routers, switches, etc.) in the testbed  Running tests on the entities with subprocess and paramiko  Collecting log files and other trace data from testbed entities  Parsing log files and trace information to collect statistics with basic text processing and regex and storing them in appropriate Python data structures like lists, tuples and dictionaries for easy access  Analysing collected statistics with Python math and generating reports  Visualizing graphs from statistics with python-gnuplot or matplotlib   I hope that after attending my talk, you will be able to automate your testbed experiments to the extent of spending less time on experimentation and data collection and more time on actual research and publishing papers",

The workshop is to be divided in two parts: \n1. Giving a hands on of using word embeddings to encapsulate the textual information and basics of how to train a vanilla GAN.\n2. Combining the word embedding and training a 2 stage stacked GAN to generate relevant Image ( We will be providing with pre-trained models as training takes a lot of time )  The workshop would then aim to go over the plausible applications that it could have.\nThe first part of the workshop will be as follows:   We would be teaching basics aspects of NLP i.e word embeddings with hands on experience of python libraries NLTK etc.  We would be then moving on to the next part where we will teach the basics of how to train a vanilla GAN on their laptops using Pytorch followed by a simple application.  We will be providing the audience with Jupyter notebooks with skeleton code and the remaining code will be written on the spot.\nAim of the teaching the training procedure is to get the audience a hang of what parameters to keep in mind while training a Neural Network.   The second part of the workshop will be as follows   We will be training the Gan using the word embeddings to get a rough Image representation followed by another GAN ( stacked one after other ) to get a full resolution image ( details given in Paper )  We will be providing the trained model of GAN as it requires a lot of time to train the GAN.  We will be providing the Jupyter Notebooks giving the architecture and will be writing some parts of the Stacked GAN\u2019s on the spot.  We will be discussing the possible applications of GAN\u2019s in both research and industry.",

    "Description": "Accelerating Transfer Learning using Effective Caching Technique  Transfer Learning is something which has become a routine today. Neural Networks have a lot of parameters (millions of them) which are trained iteratively in a data-driven fashion. With these many parameters come huge representational power (ability to model hyper dimensional complex functions). In cases where we train a custom classifier (say a CNN), we might not be having that much data so the network can easily overfit when trained from scratch. So here comes transfer learning, use the previously accumulated knowledge (in form of weights in neural nets) to learn our problem.  In case of fine-tuning also we will be training final layers of the network only. (If you are not aware don't worry this will be covered). Huge networks take significant time train completely. To reduce this time comes methods of effective caching  or informally called Training with Bottlenecks  This method though is easy to implement, can give very good results.   ResNet50 which took 45 sec for an epoch to train using normal transfer learning procedure, now takes 8 sec per epoch. Which is almost 6x speed up! *   *Trained on Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050, i5-7300HQ Processor (5 category flower dataset)  Learning Outcome    Why is Computer Vision difficult problem?    The role of Deep Learning in Computer Vision    Deep Convolutional Networks for Image recognition    Different Convolutional Architectures for Image recognition    Difficulty in Optimizing large neural nets and hints for effective training    Uses of pretrained models and basis of transfer learning      What is Transfer Learning and why is it important?   Different methods of Transfer Learning     Accelerating training a neural network by caching the non-trainable model's output (Hands on Implementation in keras )    Analysing the speedups and potential limitations in this procedure     How to debug Tensorflow Program?  This presentation is not about how to debug DL model (Example DL model is not fitting well). Its about how to debug your program in programming perspective .  Debugging a tensorflow program can be difficult due to many reasons out of which some are,    The concept of computational graph construction    Abstraction of tf.Session()     many more. So we will introduce commonly used tensorflow debugging tools like (main ones are listed)    Tensorboard    Tensorflow Debugger tfdbg ",

Takeaways of this talk would be to know the answers to:  What are the current best practices in Django and what are not?\nWhich are most common and useful design patterns?\nHow to identify and implement these patterns?  Description  Design Patterns are patterns we see and code in almost every Django projects. They are scenarios for which we wished had a canonical and elegant solution.  Based on the seminal work on design patterns in the Gang of Four book and Martin Fowler's book, the talk takes you through several well known design patterns to improve your Django code. It might also cover several new patterns in web application development that you can apply to other frameworks",

    "Description": "Python is a wonderful programming language because of its lack of boilerplate.  However, one remaining area of boilerplate is import statements.  When writing a python program, it's tedious to go back and forth to the top of the file to add and remove import statements.  When using Python interactively, it's tedious to type import statements.  I have created a tool called Pyflyby to automate imports.  Pyflyby has two killer features.  (1) With one button, Pyflyby automatically modifies your Python code to add necessary imports and remove unnecessary imports.  You can integrate into your editor or use the command-line tool.  (2) Pyflyby enhances IPython/Jupyter to automatically import symbols on-demand.  I started Pyflyby in 2011 as a side project.  It has become wildly popular within my firm; most developers at my firm swear by it.  I recently open sourced Pyflyby to make it available to the community.  In this talk, I will present how to use Pyflyby, how it works, and how it has changed Python development at my firm",

    "Description": "Catastrophic floods had a deep impact on the early human psyche resulting in a potpourri of great flood stories ingrained in the mythology of early human civilisations spread across the globe. Despite all the human progress floods can still cause massive property damages, economic losses and casualty. Several major cities and towns in India reported a series of devastating urban floods in recent times, and the resulting human and financial loss makes study of models that can identify the flood risk of an area extremely relevant.  This talk focuses on geo-spatial analytics and describes multiple techniques that can be used to assess the flood inundation risk of a geographical area. The techniques use freely available data captured by different satellites. The talk will demonstrate how we can use python libraries and Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to analyse a terrain with respect to it's elevation. The talk also also focus on how to build a first order flood fill model to identify flood inundation risks  of a geographical area due to overflow of water from a nearby water body, and due to heavy rains.  Some key take-aways from this talk are   An introduction to various types of Remote Sensing data with extensive focus on Digital Elevation Models (DEM)  Various types of public data sources available for Geospatial Analytics  Working with translator library for raster and vector geospatial data like GDAL  How to use other geospatial libraries like PyDEM for topographic analysis  Descriptive Analytics using Python packages like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib etc.",

    "Description": "When I started using Python for scientific computing, it was simply a tool that helped me get the results I needed. It was a simple tool with a large and helpful community. Most of my code was simply an working amalgam of solutions found on Stack Overflow. I didn't take the time to learn about the fundamentals of the language, the tools that the language provided and the best practices. Only after I started working professionally did I take the time out to learn Python at a more basic level.  As professional software developers, I think our job is to not just write code that works but to write code that uses the best practices. It's our duty to keep ourselves up to date about the advancements in the language and understand the language and the ecosystem at a more fundamental level.  Towards this end, I will talk about a few language fundamentals such as attribute access on classes, decorators and closures in Python. I will talk about best practices such as using list comprehensions instead of explicit for loops. I will introduce a number of packages in the standard library that help write better Python code such as argparse and Path. Finally, I will introduces resources that helped me better understand the language and the ecosystem such as online documentation, books and talks by experts",

    "Description": "Nowadays everyone follows agile and care about code quality and testing their code, which gives them the confidence to maintain their application. Do people take shortcuts while writing unit tests? what are the common things to look out for while writing unit tests and good patterns to follow?  This talk would be focused on those set of people who already know about unit testing in Python but they often feel the need of knowing the unit test best practices or they question themselves whether they are doing it the right way or not. Writing unit tests for your code is fairly simple but if you don't write them in the correct way or not following some of the best practices then it becomes a nightmare in the long run. Some of the things that will be covered during the talk are, why your unit test suite should be faster, effective usage of mock/stub.  During my talk, I'd not only be emphasizing on writing good quality unit tests and would also hope to motivate the audience to follow these practices by showing them some practical use cases. For this, I'll be illustrating real code examples of such scenarios, best practices, and principles during the talk. How do tests help maintain good documentation? Why people suggest following TDD and how tests help to improve the design of your code and maintain for the long run",

    "Description": "Note:- This talk will be co-presented by Me and Saurabh Ghanekar.  Talk Summary:-  For a long time we have faced many problems in transferring a file from one place to another without the use of a central server. But with the use of peer to peer, BitTorrent protocol, it is relatively easy for us to share our data. But there is a problem in here. It is not fully decentralized. There are still centralized servers that host these files. Moreover we at our college find it quite difficult to share our study material over LAN as nobody hosts their study materials (duh!!!). So we decided to create a decentralized file sharing application that enables us to share our file to all our friends even if we didn\u2019t hosted it on a server.  In this talk we will be explaining the basics of decentralization. We will expand on what and how this could be used to make a file sharing application. We will also shed some light on how to make a fairly secure file sharing application based on the topics we will be covering at the beginning of our talk. Once we are through with the theory and our code, we would be presenting our proof of concept i.e. a small demo of the application.  Outcome of the Talk:-  After this talk you would expect to learn the basics of decentralized network, how to make a secure decentralized application and successfully learn how to make a decentralized file sharing system.  Agenda:-   Brief Introduction of Decentralization. [6 min]  Basics of File Transfer over a Network. [4 min]  What a fairly secure File Sharing Network mean? [5 min]  Making and Implementation of making a Decentralized File Sharing Network. [10 min]  Making and Implementation of making a Decentralized File Sharing Network. [10 min]  A small Live Demo.

We will be presenting a live demo on intentionally made vulnerable Django applications with real-life use cases. We will understand how hackers may exploit them, common mistakes developers might make which can lead to a specific vulnerability and how to patch them/build them securely along with secure coding best practices.

    "Description": "Command execution time can become important in a number of applications. Commands executed in command-line completion need to execute in less then 100ms or users will perceive a delay. In Shell scripting one might want to execute commands repeatedly in a for loop and fast execution times makes this more feasible.  Python is a very powerful language but has a much slower startup time compared to other interpreted languages like Perl, Lua and Bash. It can take up to 10 times longer to startup then some of these other languages.  MicroPython was written as a lean implementation of Python 3 with a small subset of the standard library mainly intended to run on microcontrollers. But it happily runs on Unix systems with excellent startup performance, making it an ideal candidate for implementing certain time sensitive commands.  This talk will:    Explain when achieving fast execution times matters and when it doesn\u2019t.    Present two different approaches to measuring command execution time, one simple and the other more detailed and accurate.    Compare execution times of a simple set of scripts that add two numbers in an number of different interpreted languages (micropython, python3, awk, perl, lua, bash).    Present an example use case of MicroPython on Unix. Bash completion for pip install that completes the names of available packages live from a remote pypi mirror.    Demonstrate the auto completion script with pip on a local pypi mirror. ",

    "Description": "Learn how to build a snow globe that sounds an alarm and flashes a red alert when intruders are about. Me and my six year old daughter designed and built this project to have fun with friends and learn a bit about computers along the way.  Adafruit\u2019s Circuit Playground Express is a fantastic $25 computer packed with sensors, buttons, LEDs and a little speaker. Add this DIY Snow Globe Kit and some Conductive Thread and we have the makings of an ingenious Snow globe intruder alert system. All written in python using a simple text editor without the need for any special software, drivers or soldering.  The globe has a rainbow mode that randomly fades different colors in and out and an alarm mode to detect intruders. Modes can be switched by giving the globe a tap which it detects with it\u2019s motion sensors. Once in alarm mode the globe will flash green until an intruder steps on the conductive thread which will sound the alarm and flash the globe red.  The Circuit Playground was used to teach my six year old daughter the differences between computer inputs and outputs and how to issue commands to computers using the Python REPL. She learned about the different frequencies of sound waves by calling the beep function with different frequencies. This opened up the topic of the hearing range of humans compared to other animals like dogs.

    "Description": "At Sumo logic which is entirely cloud-based, one component of it resides out of the cloud and rests in the hands of users, in their own infrastructure. This component is sumo's installed collector. This is an installable package for which various forms of binaries get generated in form of rpm, deb, tar, sh, exe and docker images. These packages, along with a plethora of functionalities of the installed collector, need a test bed which not only gives the user freedom to select which tests to run but also which kind of OS the packages might be installed at.  We have created a testbed which is multi-platform and runs on the back of AWS cloud infra. The automation testbed has been designed such that we get to write code in a platform agnostic manner, hence the same set of tests can be run in Windows, Debian or RHEL systems. The testbed helps us with managing various versions of installed collectors and help us with verifying our upgrades and various flows across them.  We use Ansible for our box setups, of various Linux and windows types, and pytest to write various test scenarios, these tests verify various functionalities of collector along with the installer themselves.  Using pytest we can leverage huge armada of python libraries available such as ansible libraries, fabric, sumo's own search, metrics libraries. This kind of test-bed has uniquely brought down our 2 weeks of tests cycles to now less than 3 days and gives us immense confidence in delivering projects at a much rapid pace",

    "Description": "How many times have you banged your head on the wall while using Javascript to build a page showcasing your shiny new Python project?  Wouldn't it be great if your blog readers could run and play with the code right away?  Fancy running Jupyter-like notebooks entirely in the browser without any server?  This talk will get you a headstart into running Python directly in the browser.  Agenda  Introduction (2 mins)   About me  Why the Browser is an important stack to target?   Three major approaches (20 mins)  We will be peeking at the official demo and docs for these projects and dig deeper on how they work. Brief details below :   Transpilation - Python code is converted to Javascript before the page is loaded. Examples include PyScript and Transcrypt  Python implementation in Javascript - Python code conversion to JS takes place in the browser itself Examples include Brython , Skulpt and Batavia  Brython converts Python code into JS in the browser with access to the DOM elements and events The way Batavia works is marvelous! It takes the bytecode for the Python program generated and interprets the Python bytecode as a running program in the browser realtime using a Javascript implementation of the Python VM.  Web Assembly - Converting full implementations of Python to run on the web Examples include PyPyJS and Pyodide   PyPyJS as the name suggests is the entire PyPy implementation compiled to Javascript. It is PyPy compiled for the web via emscripten, with a custom JIT backend that emits asm.js code at runtime.  Pyodide takes this to a different level. It takes the entire Python scientific stack and compiles it to run on the browser using Web Assembly. That means every data library you love - numpy, pandas, matplotlib will run directly on the browser - no installation needed!   Conclusion (5 mins)   Learnings about Python internals  This area is still in its infancy - what to look forward to?",

Generating human like natural voice has been a topic of research for a long time and a quite challenging task. But recent development in field of Speech Synthesis using advance deep learning technologies has made it achievable.  Speech Synthesis has been integral part of any voice driven application. Although we have been able to generate good quality voice using standard method but in reality the generated voice is still too robotic ,emotionless and far away from the actual human voice. In the recent AI development in this field has made it possible to generate expressive human level voice. There are many recent papers like wavenet ,Tacatron and deep voice which do well upon precisely generating actual human voice and even mimic any person voice.  In this talk , I will cover literature of voice synthesis and how we can generate human level voice without doing phd in speech processing.  Key Components of talk :  1. Understand the basic literature of speech synthesis 2. Components of speech synthesis engine. 3. How to create own voice dataset. 4. Building basic text to speech engine using Tacotron2. 5.

    "Description": "Is there a better time to be a developer! Thanks to Cloud Computing, deploying applications is much more comfortable than it used to be. Serverless computing is an abstraction layer in the cloud. It does not mean that there are no servers, but instead, underlying infrastructure (VM, storage, containers, etc.), as well as the operating system, is abstracted away from the developer. Applications are run in compute containers that are event triggered. Developers have to create functions and depend on the infrastructure to allocate the proper resources to execute the task. Manage the load by creating copies of the functions and scale to meet the demand.  OpenFaaS (Functions as a Service) is a framework for building serverless functions with Docker Swarm or Kubernetes which has fantastic support for metrics. We can package/deploy any simple API / service as a function.  At a high level in this session:  We will discuss and implement a live python function via template and deploy this python functions to Docker Swarm & Kubernetes.  We will design and host a page which is broken into many functions.

The extent of impact social media has caused on the human mind is huge and perhaps, hard to imagine.  Thanks to python and it's brilliant capabilities to process natural language, we can now understand how social media is affecting our lives from a psychological perspective and if it is capable of changing our behaviors, our expressions, our sleeping patterns, or even emotions. From social posts, we can draw interesting conclusions about both men and women if we can comprehend what are the topics they are most interested in, what time of the day are they most and least active etc.  Core idea:   Collect a dataset from Twitter (or any other social network) of the world's top 400 most influential women for the year 2013 and for the year 2018  Train an NLP model and use this model to classify the collected data under various categories like education, religion, etc. and identify if the post is a concern, compliment, complaint etc.  Perform a year-wise trend analysis to identify the topics they are most interested in and parameters like the most/least active time of the day, the most active/least active day of the week the average time spent on twitter per week/month etc.  Carry out behavioral analysis by evaluating how the ways of expression, activity levels etc. have changed on social media over the last five years and what might have been the possible reasons for the same   Structure:   5-10 mins \u2013 Introduction and discussion ( algorithms and concepts being used )  10-20 mins \u2013 Code walkthrough followed by discussions on the results obtained (Please refer the core idea section for more details)  Remaining time \u2013 Q/A or general discussion   Contents:    An introduction to natural language processing - text normalization, n-grams, PoS tagging  An introduction to deep learning - neural networks and neural language models (framework - keras)  A brief discussion on the implementation of a sentiment classifier - Naive Bayes classifier/RNN classifier  If time permits, test out a few tweets to understand the working of the classifier  Conclusion - how can the results help identify opinions, attitudes, emotional states & future scope (of the project)   Note: The entire talk will be a powerpoint based presentation along with illustrative code snippet",

    "Description": "Blockchain is one of the most revolutionary technologies of our times, which is still maturing and with immense potentials yet to be realised.  In essence, it is a distributed public database of records which opens rooms for cryptocurrencies and smart contracts to be built on top of it.  While the internet is abuzz with blockchain, the concept is difficult to comprehend in its entirety. It lies at an intersection Game Theory, Cryptography, Network and Data Transmission, Economic and Monetary Value, and Trust Systems. It becomes difficult to wrap one's head around each of these domains and get a 360 view of the subject. The workshop tries to help the audience build a comprehensive understanding of the subject, with Python being the programming language.  The attendees will leave with a complete picture of the moving pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that blockchain is, and by the end of it will be able to build their own blockchain, cryptocurrency and a smart contract POC on ethereum.  The workshop is divided into three parts :   Context Building - 45 mins  Blockchain fundamentals and principles  - 90 mins  Coding a smart contract in Vyper (pythonic solidity)  - 30 mins   1. Context Building :   Basic of Game Theory - Introduction and the Iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), creating matches and tournaments using Axelrod python library  Cipher encryption and decryption in python  Demonstration of network fundamentals and internet data handling  Evolution of money and trust systems and why bitcoin is not a mainstream currency  When blockchain should be avoided  Why decentralisation matters   2. Blockchain with Python:   Understanding mining, incentives, payment records, and ownership  Programming a basic prototype of a blockchain  Adding a proof of work to our prototype  Putting our prototype on a  database  Doing transactions on unique addresses  Adding decentralisation to our prototype by distributing it over a network   3. Coding a smart contract with Vyper   Understanding what a smart contract is  Programming one with Vyper on Ethereum",

Is your company growing aggressively and adding code in lots of different programming languages? Are you tired of writing HTTP clients for all your services in every programming language? Do you build your APIs with Python and then write HTTP client code in Java for your mobile apps? Do you want to deprecate your old API but are worried all your clients won't be able to keep up? - Then this is the talk for you.  Did you know that you're not the only one who has these problems? Companies big and small struggle with these but most of them seem to have settled on how to approach them. In this talk we'll look at how we can structure our data for compatibility with our present and future clients using Protocol Buffers. We'll also learn how to communicate this data effectively to our clients using GRPC, with almost no effort spent on serialisation/deserialisation. We will also see how we can write services that can be consumed by non-Python clients and how we can consume services written in languages other than Python but without having to learn a new language or a clunky framework. The goal is to build a service that is easy to write, easy to consume and scales very efficiently as the problem grows.  In short, we'll learn to do more with less.  This will be a demo-driven talk with few slides. We will look at and write real Python code that gets things done",

    "Description": "Ever wanted to play your favourite song on guitar quickly even when you don\u2019t know how to play guitar? Our Python based MIDI to guitar tabs Transcriber can help you do that:  \u2022 Find your song in MIDI format (with .mid as file extension)  \u2022 Let our Python Transcriber do its magic  \u2022 Enjoy the tablatures  Transcribing MIDI files directly to tablature creation ready JSON  A lot of people take to learning the guitar every year. But most of them give up mid-way because of one or more of the following reasons:   Guitar is a difficult instrument to learn  People want to learn guitar by playing songs but are unable to do so right from the beginning  Results are often not visible immediately depending on a person's existing knowledge of music and willingness to learn guitar   Enter Python  Though it seems to be quite easy to manually create and make the app read guitar tablatures for songs, the following challenges need to be addressed:   Readiness of the output to support playback of a song along with tablatures - this essentially means storing the timing for each note/chord (when many notes are played together) in order to play the song exactly as it is  The whole process would be incredibly time consuming   In order to overcome these challenges, a simple yet efficient solution was derived - to convert a MIDI file directly into guitar tablatures.  Python was chosen for implementation of the solution for the following reasons:   Python has a very efficient and time saving file I/O mechanism and the current use case operates completely on MIDI files and the Transcriber outputs a JSON file, which in turn is served to the client.  More libraries to read MIDI files and present them in an understandable manner than any other language and their ease of use. These libraries, when used in conjunction with each other offer all the features that Java's javax.sound.midi package offers.  Availability of renowned libraries such as numpy and scipy for the algorithm to determine most optimal finger positions  A plethora of options for using a server side framework to host the Transcriber as a service  Since Python is an interpreted language, it is really useful for quick experimentation with tools like IPython unlike languages like Java in which complete programs need to be compiled beforehand. This saved us a lot of time.   ...Where Credit is Due  The solution could not be achieved without the use of the fantastic libraries used below for reading MIDI files:   Mido by olemb  Python Midi by vishnubob  music21 by Prof. Michael Scott Cuthbert (MIT)   The authors have our gratitude.  How the Transcriber Works  The high level working of the Transcriber is as follows:   MIDI files are read and all the guitar parts in the song (commonly referred to as guitar tracks ) are extracted in the form of notes and chords  An algorithm calculates the best possible finger placement on the guitar fretboard for these notes and chords  A time driven JSON is generated for use by any platform that can parse JSON to do one or more of the following:  Play the song  Display guitar tabs in sync along with song playback  Only display guitar tabs     Why Use the Transcriber?  Some work has already been done in this area and there are existing open source solutions like TuxGuitar and a few others. But the Transcriber here produces up to 70% better results than any of these solutions.  By better , the following is meant:   Transcriber generates more easily playable tablatures  The tablatures also mimic up to 60% of most of the original tablatures",

    "Description": "Imagine a play in a small theatre, where you are a producer sitting with the audience. Let us suppose the actors are weights and there are rows and rows of TPUs/GPUs behind. The director has assured you that they have rehearsed the play about 10 times, now all you do is pray that the performance goes well\nImagine you have 100 different tasks to be performed backstage, but the theatre given to you is really tiny. How will you manage?  The answer is by optimizing the tasks. Divide tasks between individuals in such a way that you require less time and space.  But how do you manage that with a neural network? How does quantization affect neural computations?  When you are dealing with a large amount of data, one has to keep in mind the ever-changing values that one might obtain. Especially, signal data with large SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) in them, which causes different sets of data to be produced. The best way to deal with such signal data is to apply truncation or rounding off such values, typically making it a many-to-few mapping. This mapping happens from 32-bit(at training) to 8-bit(at inference).  On the other hand, traditional Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures has two main parts \u2013 the edge and the cloud. The edge is the part of the system that is closest to the source of data. It includes sensors, sensing infrastructures, machines, and the object being sensed. The edge actively works to sense, store, and send that data to the cloud.  So how does quantization help with edge computing? Does it have the potential of changing how we run models on the cloud?

    "Description": " tl;dr : As data becomes increasingly extensive, it becomes important to move your models away from the cloud to where your data is being generated to reduce latency, increase security and save internet bandwidth.  This talk will be about how you can run trained TensorFlow models on Edge devices and how you can use Edge Computing accelerators like the Neural Compute Stick to make your models run even faster.   Long Version  There are a lot of very compelling reasons for shifting computations away from the edge and into the cloud, with the most important being latency issues. Here, latency refers to the time it might take to send data to a server and then receive the response. The few seconds of delay caused by this might not be a problem for your smart home applications, but when in an industry, those few precious seconds, or even microseconds can cause a machine to breakdown or even take lives. Furthermore, many industrial processes might be happening in places where running an internet line may not be possible: a mine, for example. And even if having an internet connection is possible, most companies are hesitant to send data over an internet connection and risk exposing their data to hackers prompting them to keep their data in-house. Finally, if you have a lot of sensors, you will probably be streaming data in the order of gigabytes every hour. It does not make sense for companies to pay for the bandwidth to send that much data when most of it will be discarded anyways. Thus it is important to shift all that computation to where the data is being generated.  This talk will be about how to move your existing TensorFlow models to Edge devices like Raspberry Pi's. The talk will also introduce other Edge Computing hardware like the Neural Compute Stick to make your models run even faster on Raspberry Pi.   Why Attend this talk  This talk will give the audience an understanding of Edge devices and Edge Computing. You will also learn the best practices to deploying models on the Edge. The live demo's will also give the audience an idea about how to run TensorFlow models on embedded devices.

    "Description": "SecureDrop is an open-source whistleblower submission system that media organizations can use to securely accept documents from and communicate with anonymous sources. It was originally created by the late Aaron Swartz and is currently managed by Freedom of the Press Foundation.  In the modern age of Internet, keeping privacy in the online world has become a bigger battle ground. It became an even bigger challenge for the journalists, lawyers, and anyone else who is dealing with sensitive material. Whistleblowing and leaking have dominated news coverage in recent years. SecureDrop (a Python application) project provides a reasonably safe way for the journalists to receive tips/sensitive materials from anyone, and still safeguarding the sources and keeping the materials secured.  SecureDrop also won The Award for Projects of Social Benefit from Free Software Foundation in 2016.  This talk will be divided into three sections, why, how and what is in future.   Introduction  How is SecureDrop working in newsrooms?  The top view of the technical stack (Flask application + rest of the stack)  Tips for web developers thinking about privacy  What are the biggest challenges and threats?  What is in future? (SecureDrop workstation project: explaining the new PoC workstation using Python on QubesOS).   As a project SecureDrop has many different parts running in different systems. This talk will provide an overview of the technical backgroud of the project, and will try to help the curious minds to go a step ahead to contribute or use the similar ideas in the other applications",

    "Description": "Maintaining a high level of code quality is important for any serious project. One aspect of this is ensuring that all code is actually used. There are many reasons for dead code ending up in a project. The most common is refactoring, but another is misspellings, which are only detected at runtime for dynamic languages. Finding and removing dead code allows to keep the code base clean and reduces bugs.  This talk is focussed on how we can use Vulture to find dead code. It helps you find unused code in Python programs and it is useful for cleaning up and finding errors in large code bases. If you run Vulture on both your library and test suite you can find untested code. Due to Python's dynamic nature, static code analyzers like Vulture are likely to miss some dead code. Also, code that is only called implicitly may be reported as unused. Nonetheless, Vulture can be a very helpful tool for higher code quality.  One part of this talk is to discuss how to automate testing for dead code with Vulture. There are quite a few options available:   Adding vulture to your continuous integration testing.

    "Description": "Master data is at the heart of an efficient and effective modern business.Master data management (MDM) is the effort made by an organization to create one single master reference source for all critical business data, leading to fewer errors and less redundancy in business processes.  The real challenge is the real world data is messy and it's difficult to make a decision out of this data. There are lot of records which can be duplicates or have the same entity references which leads to ambiguity and resource consumption.  Entity resolution (ER) is the task of disambiguating records that correspond to real world entities across and within datasets. Problems associated with entity resolution are equally big\u200a\u2014\u200aas the volume and velocity of data grow, inference across networks and semantic relationships between entities becomes increasingly difficult. Data quality issues, schema variations, and idiosyncratic data collection traditions can all complicate these problems even further.

    "Description": "What is Language Model ?  Language Model is basically a way to determines how likely a certain sentence is in the language. \"You are reading my LM write up now \" is more likely to be said than \u201cNow you are my LM reading write up\u201d , even though both sentences contain only correct English words; and the sentence \"I had ice-cream with a\" is more likely to end with \"spoon\" than with \"banana\" . LM helps impart this understanding of a language to machines.  What\u2019s the need?  \"Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid; humans are incredibly slow, inaccurate and brilliant; together they are powerful beyond imagination.\" (Albert Einstein)  Computers don\u2019t understand our language! All they are programmed to understand are very specific instructions. Languages we speak are much more complex than that; you can say one thing in multiple ways, for example \"where do I go for party tonight?\" and \"could you give me name of the best restaurant near me?\" -- this is called language variability. As if this was less burden to translate to computers, sometimes you say something that can have several meanings, like \"Look at the dog with one eye\" -- this is called language ambiguity. A human being usually understands the correct meaning in the context of the conversation. A computer... doesn't really.  There are many amazing work already done in the field with Siri autocompleting what you forget to type or Google responding to your \u201cokay Google\u201d calls. This said, there still exists immense room for research in the field of making these models more and more intelligent, be it in disambiguation, intent understanding etc. The basis of all starts from a language model.  Types  Language model is broadly of two types:  Statistical LM: A language model is formalized as a probability distribution over a sequence of strings (words), and traditional methods usually involve making an n-th order Markov assumption and estimating n-gram probabilities via counting and subsequent smoothing (Chen and Goodman 1998). The count-based models are simple to train, but probabilities of rare n-grams can be poorly estimated due to data sparsity (despite smoothing techniques)  Neural LM: The use of neural networks in the development of language models has become very popular, to the point that it may now be the preferred approach. The use of neural networks in language modeling is often called Neural Network based Language Models, or NNLM for short.\nNeural network approaches are achieving better results than classical methods both on standalone language models and when models are incorporated into larger models on challenging tasks like speech recognition and machine translation.  What does it take to build a language model? A corpus large enough to contain multiple variations possible and a good model :D  Sample Use cases   Autocorrect  Automatic summarization  Automated reply to emails  Spell Corrector (Grammarly)",

    "Description": "Today DASH streams are being used industry wide in Live media (Twitch, Facebook Live, Youtube Live) and would be soon incorporated in static media delivery. We would try to go through most of the use cases we as a consumer or developer would need to utilize these or serve our very own livestream. MPEG DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) is an ISO standard employing adaptive bitrate streaming technique which works by breaking the content into a sequence of small HTTP-based file segments. Each segment contains a short interval of playback time of content, served in several bitrates/codecs, where all of this information is enclosed in a XML media presentation description (MPD). Unlike conventional streaming protocols, this works with standard HTTP servers over TCP, and can fully utilize the benefits of HTTP/2 if both client and server supports it. Naturally, most CDN's and servers can serve the dynamic stream as segmented static media files, with one dynamic entry point which delivers the MPD serving the current time.  Due to lack of open libraries handling DASH media, we would be building a DASH utility toolkit. It would be carrying out activities of segmenting (generation), re-merging (consumption), and clipping out a specific period of clip, where the on-media tasks are carried out by ffmpeg. Special care will be taken for \"dynamic\" streams which are live streams. We will go through some production code behind https://esl.atx.sx which is specialized facebook streamer, and some challenges that came up serving its 1 million users",

    "Description": "The Tor network is a group of volunteer-operated servers that allows people to improve their privacy and security on the Internet. Tor's users employ this network by connecting through a series of virtual tunnels rather than making a direct connection, thus allowing both organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy. Along the same line, Tor is an effective censorship circumvention tool, allowing its users to reach otherwise blocked destinations or content. Tor can also be used as a building block for software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features.  It has become even more important as we kept hearing all the different stories about government surveillance and how the big companies are tracking everyone on Internet. In this talk, I will showcase a few ways any Python developer\ncan make use of the Tor Project inside of their code or infrastructure and provide solutions which thinks about the users' privacy from the beginning.  Talk outline   Introduction to the Tor Project  Simple Python example to do HTTP calls using Tor network  Using Stem to control the Tor process for your project  Deploying any Python (or any otherone) web application and creating Onion service for the same  Points to remember  Nyx to monitor  More upsteam usecases (onionshare, ooni).

It is my impression that the world of deep learning research is starting to plateau.\nWhat's booming: deploying DL to real-world problems. Fran\u00e7ois Chollet   I trod the same path when I started as a founding ML Engineer, over the past two years I have learned that solid engineering is essential for building ML Application at web scale. Productionizing ML model is the last mile journey, the most dreaded and less talked about topic, knowing the right toolchain to automate your build pipeline is essential for APIfiying your ML Models.  Typical ML pipeline is accompanied by a big data infrastructure to de-normalize and preprocess the application data to prepare training data, then a microservice to expose the trained model artifact on a runtime component as a service.   In this workshop, we will explore the DevOps toolchain to build, train, test, deploy and monitor an ML Model. The focus will be on the toolchain and how to automate the entire process from commit to deployment.  To illustrate the whole process we would build a toy recommendation application for an on-demand streaming service provide Pyflix .

One\u2019s data is the extension of the person, the digital self. It should be treated as the part of our body. In the present age of massive digital surveillance, it is very difficult to protect the right to privacy. While the developers code or communicate in the digital sphere, she needs to safeguard the privacy rights of the users and the person she is communicating with, respectively. Encryption makes our life easy by protecting the digital self, whereas it makes life difficult for different surveillance agencies. GnuPG is the most trusted tool on that front. GnuPG is the free software version of the OpenPGP cryptographic software suite. This command line application permits one to encrypt and put the signature on your data and communication.  There are Python modules which allow easy access to GnuPG\u2019s key management, encryption and signature functionality from Python programs. In the talk, we will learn how to use the same in your Python application, which will in turn help to protect the privacy of the users for your application.  Why does this talk matter in current times?  Keeping the users safe, keeping their right to privacy protected is one of the major concern for the modern application developers. Using the GnuPG tool with Python binding makes it easier for the application developers to protect the information. This talk will help new Python programmers to use GnuPG to jumpstart using GnuPG in their application safeguarding the users. This talk will also throw some light on the general usage of the GnuPG for the community at large. \u201cPower of community, which is at the heart of the GPG encryption,\u201d says Thenmozhi Soundararajan the Executive Director of Equality Labs",

The difficulty of visual pattern recognition becomes apparent if you attempt to write a computer program to recognize digits. Neural networks approach the problem in a different way. The idea is to take a large number of handwritten digits, known as training examples, and then develop a system which can learn from those training examples. In other words, the neural network uses the examples to automatically infer rules for recognizing handwritten digits. Furthermore, by increasing the number of training examples, the network can learn more about handwriting, and so improve its accuracy",

    "Description": "The rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses fundamental challenges for the creative industry. Although AI technologies are being adopted at an ever faster pace, Design as an academic discipline has so far failed to provide a convincing answer to the opportunities and challenges of AI. As the number of interfaces between humans and information multiplies, so do the amount of design frameworks that are required to support this technology.  When it comes to the Internet of Things (IoT), it\u2019s easy to focus on technological aspects. You can talk about different platforms or discuss which IoT solution might be the best to solve a specific problem. Looking below this layer of technology, it quickly becomes apparent that there are many more aspects that determine the success of the IoT. Not the least of which is the matter of how today\u2019s connected products are designed.  Artificial Intelligence (AI), which was designed initially to replace highly repetitive, manual work, has exceeded expectations to complete tasks involving emotional creativity. A limiting factor of IoT is it adds devices and buttons which makes your life more complicated. Now with AI, you\u2019re able to say things like \u2018turn on the lights\u2019 instead of pushing buttons, and it makes life simpler. It is the AI layer of natural language processing that helps IoT improve our lives.  In tapping into technology\u2019s potential, it\u2019s important to remember the end user \u2014 us humans. But as more and more experiences are built with ML, it\u2019s clear that UXers still have a lot to learn about how to make users feel in control of the technology, and not the other way round. How do we create experiences that are user friendly and human-centric, while taking advantage of technology?  This talk will discuss some of the guidelines focusing on human-centered approach and can be used as reference by any UX designer to help navigate the new terrain of designing ML-driven products.  As ML starts to power more and more products and experiences, let\u2019s step up to our responsibility to stay human-centered, find the unique value for people, and make every experience great",

    "Description": "The Problem  As technology becomes cheaper and more available, we start taking it for granted. Nowhere is this more true than in\nmachine learning. As machines become cheaper and data becomes more and more voluminous, our approach to specific\nmachine learning problems often, and understandably, becomes haphazard. Since GPUs are much cheaper and more widely\navailable than ever before, we implicitly believe that throwing enough artificial neurons at a problem will eventually\nsolve it. While this by itself may be true, it is not uncommon for ML practitioners to realize - unfortunately only in\nhindsight - that most of the iterations required to build a successful predictive model were unnecessary. Ironically,\nthese 'missteps' are often what lead us to the correct answer. Solving a machine learning problem is like traversing a\nminefield, where the safest path can only be determined by blowing up a significantly large number of mines. You can\nonly figure out the right approach after making a bunch of mistakes. Since there is no general rule for determining a\n'best model', most things in deep learning can only be solved with trial and error. To a large extent, this 'see what\nsticks' approach cannot be avoided. However it can be curbed significantly, with a structured approach to running\nmachine learning experiments. This structured approach is what this talk is about.  The Solution  The building blocks of neural networks and the science behind them, including that of their efficiency and\ntrainability, are already very well understood [1]. The heuristics required to ascertain reasonable convergence and\npredictive accuracy have also been studied in detail [2]. On a very high level, these best practices are simply a\nresult of studying and understanding the underlying mathematics of neural networks. However, the lack of a structured\napproach prevents us from fully utilizing these best practices. The ideal way of managing machine learning experiments is\nwith a lab journal. Each machine learning experiment can be reasonably characterized by a hypothesis, a procedure and\nfinally drawing inferences from it's results. A well kept journal would help practitioners from repeating mistakes,\nand narrowing down to the right approach.  The Tools  This talk will introduce a lab journal powered by Python, and optimized for deep learning experiments. It will allow\nusers to log experiments carried out on sklearn estimators and keras models. The journal also behaves like a\nhyperparameter grid manager, which also alerts the user if the user accidentally re-runs the same experiment on the\nsame data with the same parameters. It will have some meta-learning features which allow for an end-to-end approach to\nmachine learning experiments.  [1]. Efficient BackProp  [2]. Improving Deep Neural Network",
