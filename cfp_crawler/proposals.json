    "Description": "My talk would be starting from the very grounds of machine learning . What is it and how is it connected with our biological brain. I will be introducing some biological concepts and infrastructure of our brain to explain to them how our natural ability of thinking and deduction work, because at last the whole field of artificial intelligence is just an attempt to mimic our brain. Isn't it?\nThis will be through a series of fun QnA . Then we will see the mathematics core which enables us to lay down the logic and basics of the brain as formulas . \n- Then we will start with the classic linear regression . Will study the basic idea behind it and also see what kind of problems we should apply it.\n- Next will be the logistic regression , a classification algorithm. Learn the difference between these two and how logistic regression could be implemented and study the beautiful mathematics behind it. \n- Then we will go for a clustering algorithm, that is, Knn . Study the simple dynamics and application of this algorithm\n- Then a glimpse over the structure and mathematics of neural network . As this talk is for the novice I would keep the mathematics to the minimum and would no go deep into \"deep\" learning.\nWe will wrap up seeing some of my projects in action so that the audience could feel the power of AI",

    "Description": "The workshop will walk the audience on how to implement a state of the art object detector (YOLO: You only look once) from scratch using the PyTorch deep learning framework.  The main The aim is not to merely show the audience how to implement the detector that can work on videos, but give them a deep insight about the problems that rear their heads only when one is implementing a deep architecture. Some of these issues include,    Rapid Prototyping with PyTorch : Which PyTorch classes and abstractions to use to quickly code up neural network. How to implement a layer if it doesn't already ship with PyTorch. Our detector has 3 such layers!    How to deal with complex architectures efficiently : What if your network has more than a 100 layers? Our detector certainly has 106 ! Do we write 106 lines of code for each layer? What if we want to run our detector over a folder containing 100000 images that we can't fit into our RAM at once. Best PyTorch practices to get around problems like these will be discussed.    Speeding up Python code with Vectorisation : Python can be a slow language, but PyTorch does provide a lot of functions that are merely wrappers for super fast C code under the hood. Vectorisation and broadcasting will be covered in great detail. Using vectorised code instead of loops to do iterative tasks can give speed ups as much as 100x. Our detector can not work in real time without these optimisations.    Managing GPU resources : How to write device-agnostic code, parallelize GPU/CPU ops, practices to reduce redundant GPU memory usage, and how to time GPU code.      We will review the entire code base, and spend much time on justifying design decisions. A lot of non-critical code will be provided as it is to the audience, while they are expected to code along when it comes to the critical parts. These parts would be discussed in greater detail.  Important PyTorch features might also be demonstrated using toy examples outside the detector code base, which the audience is also expected to code along.  A docker image as well as Jupyter notebook will be provided to the audience. Google Colab may also be considered with notebooks provided.  Most of the tutorials online demonstrate how to write code that is more proof-of-concept rather than being performant. When it comes to learning to code complex architectures, especially when we are transitioning from beginner to intermediate stage, most of us have to rely on the laborious process of reading open source code. The idea of this workshop is to help audience move along this journey",

    "Description": "There lies a huge gap between a website made as a hobby/college project and that made for professional purposes. The journey to cross this is marked through database optimizations, consistent look and feel, efficient cache layer and many other things! My talk is going to be about highlighting the flexibility and power python gives in this case.\nI'm going to share my experience of building a tool for Wikipedia under Outreachy Round 15 (https://www.outreachy.org/). The tool summarizes the contributions of the Wikipedia editors and presents it in a CV-like format. The biggest challenge here was dealing with millions of edits and doing all the related computations within seconds. Without any kind of optimizations, the page took 3 hours to load. Through my talk, I want to bring out the journey from 3 hours to 3 seconds on the table! Broad outline of my talk is as follows:   Deciding upon the web framework : In this, Django, Flask and Pyramid will be compared.  Reducing the response time : When one is dealing with a dataset as huge as that of Wikipedia's, response time becomes of paramount importance. Optimizations like implementing a cache layer , using cron jobs , sessions etc will be discussed. Also, design choices will be compared - like cache layer using database vs sessions in python.  Database Optimizations : In this I'll be covering how database choice and query optimizations can affect the performance when dealing with large datasets. In this, ORM will be discussed in detail.  Component based approach with plain javascript : When one component of your website slows down the rendering of the whole page, what should one do? This is going to be another aspect that I'm going to touch upon - dividing page into pagelets without using any javascript framework.  Let code speak of professionalism :  Lastly, I'll be discussing about the good coding techniques and practices that should be used. (Like making dependency graph of modules for better modularity.) Hope you will find this talk interesting. :)",

But as the codebase scales, so does the difficulty in managing it. And as the applicability scales up, so does the difficulty in maintaining performance.  In this workshop, we will walk through how these problems crop up in the first place, and how to tackle them. This workshop will NOT cover scalability from the perspective of distributing data loading and computation across multiple compute units (horizontal scalability). We will focus more on how to write code from the very start that is both efficient in performance and makes a larger codebase manageable.  The topics we will go through are:  1.Performance - How should one write \"fast\" code   Finding the bottleneck - Profiling  Compiling Python to C - JIT vs AOT / Cython vs Numba vs Pythran vs PyPy - How they differ and choosing which one is for you  Concurrency - To parallelize or not to parallelize, to sync or not to sync  Choosing the right data structures  Hacks and bits that can get us the extra performance   2.Design Principles - How should one write \"good\" code, because we have all written code that we have difficulty in understanding ourselves in no time   Logging - Keeping track of what happened when and where  Type Checking - The why and the how  Unit Tests and beyond",

    "Description": "\"Data is the new Oil!\"  But, what is the benefit of this oil if you cannot refine (analyse) and sell/use (derive value) it. Big Data has pushed the frontier of analytical processing to gather more actionable insights in the past decade from having separate analytical servers to performing analytics close to the Data Lake/Cloud. A new paradigm of FOG computing has recently emerged which enables analyzing data at the Edge (close to the data capture device). This talk will focus on Edge Analytics enabled by Python & Raspberry Pi.  Why attend this session?  This session will provide a first hand look into the paradigm of FOG computing and Edge analytics. Model deployment is a critical part of the analytics life-cycle and this talk will provide insights and best practices to ensure seamless and robust model deployment. Also, the audience will get a flavor of python in embedded devices through the live and interactive demonstration using Raspberry Pi.

    "Description": "This tutorial is meant to familiarize participants with Tensorflow, generally as a tensor library and particularly as a tool for doing day-to-day machine learning tasks. The ultimate goal of the tutorial is to be able to make participants comfortable enough with it so that they can use tensorflow as a scalable substitute for other ML libraries like sklearn.  Why Learn Tensorflow?  For the same reason that you should learn NumPy. Tensorflow is to Keras (and many other deep learning libraries) what NumPy is to sklearn (and many other machine learning libraries). It is the underlying data model of many deep learning applications. There are always nooks and crannies in any deep learning application that high level wrapper libraries cannot reach. The tutorial is aimed at making these accessible and debuggable with tensorflow.  What will I learn?  The focus of the tutorial would be on loss functions - ensuring their fundamental correctness with respect to the machine learning problem at hand, ensuring their differentiability and convergence are critical to solving a deep learning problem. There are many ready-made loss functions in tensorflow, and using these as building blocks, we will see how to make arbitrarily complex loss functions.  FAQs:   Q. Will I need a GPU?  A. No. The beauty of tensorflow is that it can seamlessly deploy code to GPUs, without you needing a GPU to develop that code.   Q. What is the format of the tutorial?  A. Being a tutorial, this session is meant to be highly interactive in nature. It will be a sequence of units where concepts are first explained and then the audience will have to solve exercises in a Jupyter notebook.   Q. I don't know anything about neural networks or deep learning. Should I attend this tutorial?  A. Absolutely. The focus is on tensors, which are the domain of tensorflow, and not on network layers, which are domain of keras",

Currently healthcare is broken; there\u2019s shortage of doctors; poor quality of care. There is a dire need to provide assistance to the whole medical industry to improve healthcare.  PyTorch, which is a very popular modular deep learning framework for fast, flexible experimentation is an invaluable resource for such problems. It supports seamless conversion of Numpy arrays into GPU tensors and vice versa. The dynamic computational graph allows to change the network behavior on the fly unlike static graphs and due to Its highly modular nature helps in fast debugging.  Unlike other production grade tools, Pytorch helps with lots of Research and Experimentation with novel architectures and is very useful to test ideas a bit more quickly and prototyping.  With Medical Imaging being the field most impacted by AI, our goal in this workshop is to give a good head start covering the heuristics of Medical Imaging, the concepts involved in it and how to code your way out.   This workshop would be divided into two halfs.    First Half: Pytorch Introduction\nDuration: 1 hour 20 minutes\nThe first half would be a gentle introduction to PyTorch framework. We will introduce the audience with the basics of PyTorch. This workshop will cover topics like:    What is PyTorch? (Use cases and war stories)   Tensor 101  Ndarray/Tensor library  Numpy Bridge,  Fast CPU to GPU conversion of tensors  The automatic differentiation engine or autograd  Difference between Static and Dynamic computational graphs  Advantages of dynamic computational graph with examples  The optimization package  Scope of debugging  Ecosystem  Linear Code flow in Pytorch (One of the core philosophy of PyTorch)  Saving and loading models*  Deep Learning workflows*  Tutorial on Transfer Learning.*  Workflows which involve writing custom data-loaders will also be introduced in brief.*    A 10 minute coffee/kit-kat break. :-)  Second Half: Let\u2019s dive in. Duration: 1 hour 15 minutes.   Introduction to Radiology: What is radiology? What do the images look like? How is AI used here? How will AI help improve radiology practice?  Liver, Tumor and Vessel Segmentation - setting the context of why it is needed.  Challenges faced in solving liver segmentation.  How we solved the challenges - edge maps, data imbalance  and overall architecture and data used. Hands on with live Liver Segmentation using PyTorch.

Data aggregation, summarization and visualization are some of the main pillars supporting this area of data analysis. However, dealing with multi-dimensional datasets with typically more than two attributes start causing problems, since our medium of data analysis and communication is typically restricted to two dimensions. We will explore some effective strategies of visualizing data in multiple dimensions (ranging from 1-D up to 6-D) using a hands-on approach with Python and popular open-source visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.  The talk shall be structured as follows:   Motivation for Effective Data Visualization  A quick refresher on Data Visualization  Brief introduction into python open-source frameworks for visualization  pandas  matplotlib  seaborn  bokeh    Univariate analysis with hands-on examples  Multivariate analysis with hands-on examples  Visualizing data in 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 dimensions  Visualizing a combination of numeric and categorical data  Strategies for effective data visualization  Conclusion",

Open the editing software, select what you want to configure(filters, Sharpness, etc.) and you're done. Quite easy, right? But what if you know how the back-end of how these softwares run? what if you know the what kind of codes make your camera detect objects? Well with OpenCV and python its simpler than you can imagine!  My talk will be about OpenCV with Python. OpenCV is an acronym for Open Source Computer Vision Library . Its a library used for image processing. The code can be written in C++, Java or Python but since we all love Python, we'll use that. We will be using ' cv2 ' library for all the image processing and detection. My talk will feature:   How images are stored in computer and how each pixels store image.  Different types of Colour Bands and the role of Colour Bands in forming an image.  Editing images with cv2 library in python.  Blurring, Sharpening, Greyscaling, and other uses of image kernels.

They may be as vulnerable as a child getting influenced by inappropriate sources encouraging racism, sexism or any unintended prejudice. Models learn exactly what they are taught. The more biased your data is, the more biased is your model.  For instance, a text model by Google says how \u201cEngineer is to a Man\u201d is the same as \u201cHousewife to a Woman\u201d. This shows how incidental data can lead to unintended bias. Machines are given the power to judge so there is a need for us to ensure we prevent biased/unfair judgements. In this talk, we are going to discuss  What is Machine Learning bias?  How is it caused?  Different ways to identify bias?  Techniques to prevent bias  One Famous example of bias:",

    "Description": "Offensive / abusive content is a major issue for social-media and digital interaction platforms. In some jurisdictions (Eg: Europe), platform providers are required by law to remove such content within 24 hours of posting or risk hefty fines (upto \u20ac50M in Germany). In order to meet the governance mandate, we need to have systems in place that can automatically detect abusive content at scale. This talk is based on my practical experience of building an automated solution to solve this problem.  This talk begins with discussing some of the approaches currently being employed for offensive content detection at scale: word filtering, rule-based systems and actual human annotation.  The former two are restricted by the following:   Offensive content is context specific. A given word (f ck) can be used in both positive (that\u2019s f cking awesome) and negative (that\u2019s f*cking terrible) contexts.  Robustness to spelling variations (The word \u2018shit\u2019 can be spelt as \u2018sh*t\u2019, \u2018sh!t\u2019, etc)  Failure to detect content that is offensive in idea but uses non-offensive words. (Eg: your mom is a fat cow, X people are inferior, etc)   Manual human annotation is notoriously hard (ask Google!) and expensive to scale. The talk presents a Deep neural network based approach to overcome the previously mentioned limitations. It introduces and discusses the building blocks of model architecture (deep convolutional networks, word embeddings, etc).  The second half of the talk focuses on implementing the above model to solve the problem at scale as a RESTful micro-service using python, Django, Tensorflow and Docker. This architecture can also be used to implement other text classification systems as well (eg: user intent detection systems, topic-of-discussion classifiers, etc.), making the talk relevant for a wider user base.  Attendees will:   Gain insights into building deep learning based text-classification systems that can scale  Learn the nitty gritties of the offensive content detection and text classification  Learn about the basic concepts of Deep Learning and NLP (convolutional neural nets, multi-layer perceptron, word embeddings, etc.)  Understand the scientific and software challenges involved in text classification and learn to overcome them  Be able to apply the learnings from here to other text classification problems as well",

    "Description": "Data proliferation is putting pressures on business leaders to become data-driven. Although, leaders have to rely on data analysts to run those queries and get insights out from data warehouses. Its a common principle-agent problem wherein data analysts only ask questions from data which they are directed to ask, but its never a one-way street. One has to flirt with data for a long time to get to know it and leaders get stuck in the loop of data analyst direction as leaders are not equipped with or don't have time to write SQL queries.  This calls for a natural language query wherein a business leader can ask a question in simple plain English and data is spitting out either in a table or graph. This session is guided towards how Innovaccer has solved this problem and provides an architecture, knowledge base building, and natural language processing guidance to build one on your own. The session will also emphasize on the fact that accuracy of such a software will be very poor if it is industry agnostic as SalesForce and ThoughtSpot have tried in the past. Thus, one has to tame it to their own business context or vertical",

    "Description": "In this talk, I am going to talk about advanced concepts of Python related to Caching.   A cache can be easily understood as a saved answer to a question. Caching can speed up an application if a computationally complex question is asked frequently. Instead of the computing the answer over and over, we can use the previously cached answer.  Caching is an important component while scaling applications which are to be used by many users. It solves various problems related to cost and latency. Usually it takes more time to retrieve data from DB rather than cache. Using a cache to avoid recomputing data or accessing a slow database provides us with a great performance boost.  I will describe in depth the different methods of Caching, their pros and cons. This talk will help developers focus on their code before scaling their applications. It will provide immense performance improvements with this simple concept.  Outcomes: The novice audience will be able to understand basic Caching Mechanisms. They will be able to utiilize their knowledge which will serve pivotal while scaling applications   Contents to be covered in talk:    Local Caching: What is it, how to do it, example, built-in Python libraries: (using cachetools ), advantages, dis-advantages    Memoization: What is it, pseudo-code algorithm, implementation using example, built-in Python libraries: (using lru_cache ), advantages, dis-advantages    Distributed Caching: What is it, techniques: (using memcached , using pymemcache )     Agenda:   Initial 10 minutes: Introduction to Caching and its various techniques.  10 - 20 minutes: Examples and code walk through for various techniques.  20 - 25 minutes: Comparative analysis of how caching is better than non-scaled applications.  25 - 30 minutes: Q&A session",

    "Description": "Talk Summary:  Bitcoin has become so mainstream these days. It unveiled the importance of decentralization. But how does Bitcoin work? It\u2019s because of its core technology called Blockchain. After the Internet, Blockchain technology is regarded as the next big revolution. This talk gives a hands-on demonstration of how Blockchain technology works by building a toy version from scratch.  Outcomes:  After this talk the audience should be able to understand the basic working principles of bitcoin. They will be able to leverage their knowledge as a starting point of open-source contributions to projects like Ethereum.   This demonstration will consider three important features of Blockchain Technology. All these features are essential to blockchain technology and we will be building a minimal version in Python.  Agenda:  0 - 5 mins:\n    Blockchains are secure because they use SHA256 or SHA512 algorithm for cryptography. I will describe the logic behind these hashing algorithms and give some computational facts about them.  5 - 10 mins: \n    I will use the Python library called \u2018hashlib\u2019 to implement the SHA256 algorithm in Python. This makes us to convert data into SHA256 hashes.  10 - 15 mins:\n    The SHA256 algorithm is used to convert all the transactions and their details into a single hash. Once the everything is converted into a hash, this hash must be stored for future usage. After a new transaction is approved, this new transaction and its details are again converted into a new hash along with the previous hash. I will demonstrate the process of storing the hash and using it again for a new transaction.  15 - 20 mins:\n    Here I will explain a basic working principle of blockchains and how linking the previous transactions with the new one helps in the their security.  The hashes stored are called blocks and the process of liking the previous hash the new hash makes a chain like connection thus forming a Hyperledger.  20 - 25 mins:\n  Later in the process of mining will be explained using the variable quantity called Nonce. This explains why bitcoin miners need high computation power to do Proof-of-Work. \nI will also cover a variety of essential terms and concepts through the course of the talk which haven\u2019t been detailed in the agenda. Also, I will use python module called 'TkInter' to build a basic GUI for our blockchain.  Last 5 mins:\n    Questions and further reading + code sharin",

    "Description": "Building Web APIs seems still more an art than a science. How can we build APIs such that generic clients can easily use them? And how do we build those clients? Current APIs heavily rely on out-of-band information such as human-readable documentation and API-specific SDKs. However, this only allows for very simple and brittle clients that are hardcoded against specific APIs. Hydra, in contrast, is a set of technologies that allow us to design APIs in a different manner, in a way that enables smarter clients.  The main aim of this talk is to provide an overview of Semantic Web, Hydra Draft, and Hydrus.  Hydra - Hydra is a framework to enable REST API to be described semantically using RDF. It is based on JSON-LD and proposed as W3C draft .  Hydrus - Hydrus is a Flask server meant to build and deploy Hydra-based Web APIs in a straightforward and effective way. Hydrus utilises the power of Linked Data to create a powerful REST APIs to serve data. Hydrus uses the Hydra draft standard for creation and documentation of it's APIs.  The flow of the talk will be as follows:   My Introduction  Brief Overview of Semantic Web and JSON-LD  What is Hydra Draft?  Detailed introduction to Hydrus  How can we use Hydrus to create REST APIs easily?  Future Scope  An interactive Semantic Web demo.  Q/A session",

It will present an overview of the process, the intricacies and will end with a concrete example to show the utility.  ANTLRv4 is a tool that can generate parse trees for any compatible grammar, and provide tools to walk through that tree, so I will illustrate how to use that rather than dwelling more on the theory aspect of the parse trees and boost up the development of language tools. There is a speciality with ANTLRv4, we can separate context from the grammar (so we can get very close to the expectation that grammars are context free).  I expect the session to be beginner friendly so no pre-requisites save some basic python expected. Also I will cover some basic examples, and also a demo of an actual language grammar to create a meta-program if time permits. The session is expected to have the following things:   What is a grammar ?  What are Parse trees and how do they compare to ASTs ?  What is ANTLR ? (The parser generator and the runtime provided)  How do we use a parse tree ? (dwelling on setting up the environment for ANTLR based development and a short, basic calculator building example)  Visitors and Listeners  A short real world example on detecting technical constricts in actual programming languages (probably Python itself)",

But there\u2019s other models which could also break down a seasonal series into trend, seasonality and noise. We will use an open source Python library called Seasonal to analyse B2B worldwide travel data.   Times series analysis is an important part of data analysis for lots of businesses. It is very often for stakeholders to be interested in the performance of the business by analyzing measurements of profit, cost, number of sale, number of searches etc over time. In this talk, we will do a case study of showing how we estimate the impact public holidays made on the travel business. The method of analyzing the time series by seasonal breakdown will be explored and the work flow of solving the problem will be explained.  In the first half of the talk, an introduction about time series and its characteristic will be explained for audiences who is new to analysis on time series. The data we use will be from a business to business travel company. It has seasonality thought out the year, a weekly cycle and also a growing trend in business. As the company have clients around the world, data from different countries will shows different behaviors as well. Therefore, before we show the analysis, the complexity of the data will be explored. In the second half, we will introduce a open source Python library called Seasonal. Using this package, we will demonstrate how to break down the travel data and extract the fluctuation of the sale in different countries. By comparing the fluctuation and Google calendar, public holidays in different countries can be spotted and their impact on the business can be estimated.  This talk is for people who are interested in time series analysis and its application in business. Audiences with or without experience would also found this talk useful in giving them insights in how a business could benefit in making use of the data and doing a proper time series analysis",

    "Description": "When you make a search for a hotel room, do you know how many travel agents are searching for you at the same time? In this talk, we demonstrate how to use the millions of searches a sourcing company received to build a network of travel agents and finding the main hubs among them using NetworkX.   Network analysis is getting more and more attention in Business Intelligence, people hope to get information out of the structure of an organization or a communication network. In this talk, we use the hotel room search requests from travel agents, including online public website, B2C, B2B and B2B2C, to build a relational network among them. By using this network as an example, we demonstrate how insights can be extract by studying network properties.  In the first half of the talk, we will explain how the network is built using NetworkX, an open-source python library that is designed for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. When 2 agents are making the same search at the same time , a link ( or an \u201cedge\u201d in network analysts terms) is made pointing form the initial searcher to the subsequent searcher. Using a list of these searches, a directed graph is built. We will also demonstrate how to pick the biggest connected component out form the graph. In the second half, with the graphs created, we show how different functions of NetworkX can be used to study the graphs. By compare the graph properties of our graph to the other popular network graphs, we can get the insight of how the network was created. Also by studying the graphs, we can understand the behavior of the agents and can even figure out which agents are acting as main hubs in the network.  This talk is for people who are interested in network analysis and would like to see how it can be used in a business case. Audiences with any level of python experience can learn some basic concept of network analysis work and how it can be applied to provide business insights",

    "Description": "Ever encounter a tricky situation of knowing there\u2019s names that are the same, but matching strings straight away leads you no where? All you need is FuzzyWuzzy, a simple but powerful open-source Python library and some wit. This talk will demonstrate how to efficiently fuzzy match company names.   Matching strings should be one of the first natural language processing problem that human encounter since we start use computer to handle data. Unlike numerical value which has an exact logic to compare them, it is very hard to say how alike two strings are for a computer. One may compare them character by character and have an idea of how many characters in the pair of stings are the same. Unfortunately in most application we need computer to perceive strings like we do and therefore we have to use fuzzy matching. Fuzzy matching on names is never straight forward though, the definition of how \u201cdifference\u201d of two names are really depends case by case. For example with restaurant names, matching of words like \u201ccafe\u201d \u201cbar\u201d and \u201crestaurant\u201d are consider less valuable then matching of some other less common words. Also, do we consider company names that matches partly (like \u201cHappy Unicorn company\u201d and Happy Unicorn co.\u201d) are the same?  In the first half of the talk Levenshtein Distance, a measure of the similarity between two strings, will be explained. Different functions in FuzzyWuzzy like \u201cpartial_ratio\u201d and \u201ctoken_sort_ratio\u201d will also be explored and compared for difference. It is very important to understand our tool and choose the right one for our task. Then in the second half, we will start tackling the example problem: matching company names, we will show that besides using FuzzyWuzzy, we have to also handle problem like finding and avoid matching of common words and speeding up the matching process by grouping the names. By combining all tricks and techniques that we demonstrate, we will also evaluate how efficient this method is and the advantage of using this method.  This talk is for people in all level of Python experience who would like to learn a trick or two and would like to be able to solve similar problems in the future. Theory of how the library works will be explained and It is easy to be pick up even for beginners",

    "Description": "There are lots of reasons using a cloud service is favorable, but how to make sure consistency between development and deployment? With Docker and Terraform, we can create the same environment on cloud easily. For example, we will deploy a Jupyter notebook on Google Cloud Platform using both tools.   In this talk, we will use a task: hiring a GPU on Google Cloud Platform to train neural network, as an example to show how an application can be deployed on a cloud platform with Docker and Terraform. The goal is to have Jupyter Notebook running in an environment with Tensorflow (GPU version) and other libraries installed on a Google Compute Engine.  First we will briefly explain what is Docker and what is Terraform for audiences who has no experience in either or both of them. Some basic concepts of both tools will also be covered. After that, we will walk-through each steps of the work flow, which includes designing and building a Docker image, setting up a pipeline on Github and Docker Hub, writing the Terrafrom code and the start up script, launching an instance. From that, audiences will have an idea of how both tools can be use together to deploy an app onto a cloud platform and what advantages each tool can bring in the process.  This talk is for people with no experience in application deployment on cloud service but would benefit form computational reproducibility and cloud service, potentially data scientists/ analysts or tech practitioners who didn\u2019t have a software developing background. We will use an example that is simple but useful in data science to demonstrate basic usage of Docker and Terraform which would be beneficial to beginners who would like to simplify their work flow with those tools",

    "Description": "Computers are getting closer to speak like humans. But can we even make them speak in particular ways, like as Trump or Shakespeare? In this hands on talk we will see how this is possible with the latest deep learning techniques combined with word embeddings and other advanced NLP technique.   In this talk, first we would introduce two neural network and machine learning mechanisms which in popular and widely used in NLP (natural language processing): Word Embeddings and Recurrent Neural Network. Word Embeddings is a way to extract the context of a word by \u201clearning\u201d its presence in a paragraph; while Recurrent Neural Network, including LSTM (long short-term-memory), enable us to \u201ctrain\u201d sequential data. After that, we will showcase how to implement these mechanisms in a neutral network. With that, we can \u201cbuild\u201d a machine to generate articles, plays or speeches in the style of the training corpus and have lots of fun.  In the first half of the talk, concepts of how Word Embeddings and LSTM works will be explained. Audiences will understand why this is essential in the field of NLP and why we are using it. In the second half, a code demo will be used to showcase how to implement these mechanisms. Through an example, audiences will learn how Keras is used together with Tensorflow and Python to build a sequential neutral network. We will showcase generating a paragraph using Shakespeare\u2019s play and another one using Trump\u2019s speech.  This talk is for people who have some experience with data science and understand the concept of how a neural network works, but would like to go deeper into the details of how does it applied to NLP to solve more complex AI problems. We used very simple code but did a complex task like text generation, that opens the door for a lot of people who wants to experiment with deep learning",

    "Description": "In this talk, I will speak about a simple yet very powerful image manipulation mechanism.   The naive user utilizes the services of any standard toolkit, be it a web service or a remote application for image manipulation. The black box approach to this process is: A user provides an image and other parameters as input to the toolkit which in turn produces the results and returns it back to the user. Often these results are not up to the mark. The image sometimes gets distorted, misaligned or blurred.  Deviating from the standard mechanisms, I would like to talk about a technique called as Content aware image resizing . The primary factor in this technique is the content . It is the content which drives the entire technique. The image is cropped, enlarged or modified keeping in mind the primary factor.  I will talk about an algorithm called as Seam Carving which is used under the hood to achieve the aforementioned technique. It is this algorithm and the power of Python libraries , that makes this technique perform better than the standard mechanisms.   Agenda of Talk:   Introduction: Basics of seam carving, how the algorithm works  Understanding energy concepts, basics of computer vision and dynamic programming  Walk over the pseudo-code and dry run of algorithm  Comparative analysis of this technique with standard mechanisms  Q&A Session  Conclusion",

    "Description": "What is Transfer Learning?  Transfer Learning is the method of reusing our existing knowledge developed for one task to solve a similar task. Say, you want to detect cars on night-time images and instead of learning from scratch we could reuse our existing knowledge from a model which has been trained on day-time images. Transfer learning allows us to deal with these scenarios by leveraging the already existing labeled data of some related task or domain.  I believe Transfer Learning is a major achievement in our quest for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as Transfer Learning allows us to generalize our knowledge which is something we humans excel at.   Andrew Ng, ex-chief scientist at Baidu, co-founder of Coursera and professor at Stanford, said during his widely popular NIPS 2016 tutorial,   \u201cTransfer Learning will be the next driver of ML success.\u201d   Training Deep Neural Networks from scratch is an expensive process. Not only does it require a lot of compute resources and time, deep Learning models require a huge amount of data and it is a major bottleneck when it comes to start-ups and niche areas of research like health care.  What you will learn :-   How to build an image classifier in a few minutes using Transfer Learning  When and how to fine-tune pretrained models  Freezing layers of a pretrained model depending upon the scenario  Using ConvNet as a    feature extractor  Using differential learning rates  Constraints of using pretrained models   Transfer Learning : Beyond Computer Vision  Cross-Lingual Domain Adaptation : Using the knowledge we have learnt from one language and applying our knowledge to another language is another application of transfer learning with huge potential. Cross-lingual adaptation methods would allow us to leverage the vast amounts of labeled data we have in English and apply them to any language, particularly languages with very less labeled data such as Indian languages.  Reinforcement Learning and Learning from Simulations : Training an agent (in Reinforcement Learning) to achieve general artificial intelligence directly in the real world is too costly and hinders learning initially through unnecessary complexity. It is better to train an agent in a simulated environment such as the OpenAI Gym before deploying it in the real world. Eg: Self-driving cars  Agenda  1.Introduction to Computer Vision (3 min)  2.Introduction to Transfer Learning (3 min)  3.Why should you use Transfer Learning?

It becomes really tedious for a person to go and visit all the sources to obtain information. It could be of great help to the person if there can be a single source which cumulatively providing all the links of news generated by different newspapers. This is where web scraping and automation comes into picture.  In this talk I want to explain how to scrape webpages hassle free , gather information and represent the gathered content in a easy to visualize format. By executing just a single Python file we can get all the data what we want from the web. Its not just about collecting the data, it is to reduce the repetitive work which a person does again and again to achieve the same goal. We can put repetitive work into a module and leave it upon the computer to do the same. This in turn will help us channelize our time more on the information rather than gathering that information.

    "Description": " It is always essential to understand the genesis of evolution or the roots of revolution.   Keeping in mind the above saying, in this workshop, I will provide a hands-on understanding of Blockchain technology using Python. There are multiple resources to get a firm understanding about this domain, but the best way to understand it is by using the concept of \"Learning-By-Doing\" .   Following are few reasons why I want to willingly contribute to this domain:    Blockchain is the underlying technology behind most of the\n   cryptocurrencies and it has a potential of changing the way we work\n   and communicate, making it more secure, efficient, and trustworthy.    There is a immense amount of speculation going around in this domain\n   with the rise of Bitcoin.  What\u2019s happening with blockchain\n   technology, I would say, is similar to the great American gold rush\n   that happened in the mid 1800s.    Innovators, investors, entrepreneurs, technologists all are hovering\n   over the same underlying idea on how these cryptocurrencies work and\n   how could blockchain be leveraged to create use-cases beyond\n   crypto-systems.     Also, I would love to mention few quotes to support the escalating phenomenon of Blockchain :   The blockchain cannot be described just as a revolution.  It is a tsunami-like phenomenon, slowly advancing and gradually enveloping\neverything along its way by the force of its progression. -- William\nMougayar  Over the next decade, there will be disruption as significant as the Internet was for publishing, where blockchain is going to disrupt\ndozens of industries, one being capital markets and Wall Street. -- Patrick M. Byrne    I will help people in understanding the bits and bytes of this domain, including the basic cryptography concepts, algorithms and how to utilize the power of Python language to build their own blockchain. As we progress, we would engage into more advanced concepts pertaining to scalability and deployment once we build a minimalist prototype of aforementioned.  Using on-the-go learning while developing will serve as a pivotal entry point for all the people who are willing to enter into this space and planning to  build smart-contracts or invest in cryptocurrencies.   Agenda for workshop :   Introduction to Blockchain:  Existing problems, what is Blockchain, why it matters, gist of few use-cases, related concepts.  Python revisited:  Functions, libraries, object-oriented programming terminologies, basic data structures, basics of zen of python.  Blockchain under the hood: Cryptography 101, underlying data structure and algorithms, conceptual terminologies.  Python and Blockchain amalgamated: Create blockchain using python.  User-friendly front-end: Integrating the scripts in previous section with a basic front-end.  Discussion regarding scalability methods and resources.  Generating self-help focused Pypi library called pymyblockchain . (optional)  Q&A session.   Note: The above agenda is subject to change. It is tentative for now. Any changes will be updated here itself",

Basically Data is everything today for companies.  Data is available everywhere now and it's become more important than ever to actually work with data and luckily we have great modules to work with data in Python. I'll be focusing on these modules and the power that data possesses.  My primary focus here would be about the power of data. I surely will be talking about how to use this data in Python to make the most out of it, but before that I'd like the entire crowd to know what the power of data is.  This would be a good talk for beginners honestly. Even if you have no idea about how data could be used or what is data, after this talk, you'll get a decent idea about it. Through this talk the 3 questions mentioned above in bold will be answered.  The talk would progress in the following manner :   Self introduction (3 minutes)  Introduction about the topic (2 minutes)  What is data? (3 minutes)  Where is this data? (2 minutes)  How to make the most out of data? (3 minutes)  How Python helps in this process?

    "Description": "Abstract  Ever wonder creating your own super-type-manager leveraging the python's own type constructs?  Ever explored alternatives to APIs for integration?  In this talk, we will cover our experience in building a new type manager (as part of developing open source OpenManage(tm) Software Development Kit) leveraging pythons own type constructs and explore how this new type manager provides a credible alternative to APIs, especially in those information-heavy environments  like Device Management.  Description  Devices (like Servers, Switches, Telecom Switches) are data-intensive systems. Their information model is so intensive, that practically all operations (health, inventory, metrics, configuration) on the device ends up in primarily as CRUD operations on the information model they expose.  Only a paltry few operations are exposed as APIs.  When building an API for managing these devices, we realized that providing classic function-style APIs only degraded the user experience. What we realized was there was significant information available on the Servers, and providing an API for exposing traditional CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) for all information nuggets was just exploding the API sets.  It was not necessarily covering all the scenarios that could be possible for management and did not seem to scale.  Our approach was to take this information model within the devices and expose them as a huge navigable data structure representing the entire spectrum of the device and provide a language native experience. We created a new type manager leveraging the python class special operators ( getattr (), setattr (), le () etc.) to create a whole new type manager that provides additional controls and safeguards.  Some of the safeguards include:   Not allowing edits to read-only components  Allowing only applicable changes only (ranges, enumerations)  Providing native python experience for special types (IP Address Types etc.)  Providing mechanisms to validate cross-attribute validations  Providing custom indices for arrays (like Virtual Disks, Users)  Providing mechanism for tracking changes to configuration  Apply changes to the device optimally  Provide mechanisms for identifying configuration drifts   Outline :  Outline of the presentation:   Introduction  Device Configuration - Aspects & Peculiarities  Pitfalls of API approach for Device Configuration  Type Manager - introduction  Super Types - Enumerations, Fields, Classes and Arrays  Bringing in Native Type Experience  Data as API - Enriched user experience  Demo  Q&A   Key takeways to audience  Audience will get an exposure:   How to create your own type manager by overloading python type constructs  Exposure to alternative approach to creating APIs for data-heavy systems & explore benefits  Learn how type manager simplifies your life as well as the life of your consumers.  Secrets of the python inbuilt __ operators - and how you can leverage them to provide native type experience even for your own custom classes  How you can create a better user experience for customers in a simple way  How you can incorporate Object Oriented SOLID principles",

    "Description": "Abstract  Today, massive systems are running on microservices communicating with each other using REST APIs. HTTP is easy to get started, loosely structured and does good job in exchanging messages. But it's convenience comes with a performance trade-off, which takes us back to other optimal alternative: gRPC  Description  In this talk we will see what gRPC is and how it is different from REST. We will get started with GRPC by generating stubs for python and \nbuild a simple gRPC API server. We will try to find out the advantages of gRPC over REST by doing a side by side comparison of our APIs. We then deploy our server in Kubernetes and discuss how we could scale our microservices.  Outline   Introduction to gRPC (3 min)  gRPC concepts (5 min)  Designing the APIs REST-fully (3 min)  Going the gRPC way (5 min)  Generating python stubs    Duel: gRPC vs REST python servers (4 min)  Demo (4 min)  Deploying our gRPC apis in kubernetes    Summary (3 min)  Q & A (3 min)   Key take aways to audience   Audience will get a practical introduction to gRPC and protocol buffers.

Static blog generators have gained popularity over the last few years .  People who have been using Wordpress, Blogspot or Blogger are now shifting to Pelican , Jekyll  etc. One major annoyance was that Wordpress had a huge attack surface. Everytime someone found out a Wordpress exploit, your site was at risk.  When comparing Blogger vs Pelican, the Slant community recommends Pelican for most people. In the question \u201cWhat are the best solutions for a personal blog?\u201d Pelican is ranked 10th while Blogger is ranked 14th.  Python is becoming more and more popular amongst programmers and so is Pelican . \nPelican is a static blog generator and supports several formats like Markdown , ASCII etc . It  turns Markdown and some Jinja templates into the Full Stack Python site. Its beauty lies in its simplicity and even a non programmer can get started with Pelican in just a few lines of code and plain text .   Over the past few years people have shifted from Wordpress to Pelican .This is because a static site has basically no attack surface, and can be hosted on free or inexpensive hosts like Github Pages .\nThis talk is focused on introducing a simple static site generator to beginners and even avid bloggers who aren't coders . This talk will cover:-   Basic installation of Pelican  Writing a blog post with Pelican  Changing themes of a blog/site  Comparison between Jekyll and Pelican    The main aim of this talk is to familiarize people with the concept of edifice . I have met a lot of non coders who have asked me about creating a basic website for personal use .

    "Description": "Most machine learning algorithms require feature vectors as inputs. In pattern recognition and machine learning, a feature vector is an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represent some object (image, text, sound). Feature engineering, the practice of extraction of features from objects is a combination of art and science; it requires the experimentation of multiple possibilities and automated techniques with the intuition and knowledge of the domain expert. Automating this process is called \"feature learning,\" where a machine learns the features itself.  One way to obtain features is to use the 'Bag-of-Features' model, the idea behind which is to simplify object representation as a collection of its subparts. Originally used for representing text data, the \"Bag-of-Words\" methodology can be extended to different types of objects resulting in models such as \"Bag-of-Visual-Words,\" \"Bag-of-Audio-Words.\" The significance of these models in the age of self-learning deep networks still holds because of their ability to work with limited data.  The contents of the talk are:   Introduction to Feature Engineering  Working with Text Data  Understanding 'Bag-of-Words'  Example: Text Classification  Working with Image Data  Introduction to 'Bag-of-Visual-Words'  Example: Image Classification  Comparing the performance to CNN  Overview of 'Bag-of-Audio-Words'  Generalizing 'Bag-of-Features'   This talk primarily discusses Bag-of-Words, Bag-of-Visual-Words through an example of text classification and image classification respectively. It also covers the concepts that generalize to models other than Bag-of-Features. The goal is to acquaint the audience who have previously worked on numeric data with some ideas to get started with text and multimedia data",

    "Description": "Hey everybody!  Ever tried to webscrape?  Ever faced a \"No robots allowed! No web scraping allowed!\" message from a favorite site?  This talk is for meant for you.  Usually when you're done building a fancy web scraper and begin running the homebrew'd tool on your favorite site there's chances you'll face a block on your IP address preventing your computer from accessing more resources and therefore downloading the contents of the website. Your tool maybe fast, it might be scalable, it might be the best written scraper out there, but with just one IP address under your belt, it's easy for giants to block your ip address and prevent you from getting that precious data, especially if you've built a threadsafe and multi-node webscraper.  Enter The Onion Router,  The ToR project, allows you to use the the internet vis-a-vis a proxy and visit the same website under a different endpoint ip address, but that's just for one instance of ToR.  What if you ran, say 200? at once?  200 ip addresses > 1 ip address.  With 200 endpoints and the latest update to the requests library, you can now use your multi-threaded and resource hungry webscraper and it can(not) be stopped! Whatever your rate of data collection, you can 200x it!  The stack is simple, you open a SOCKS5 proxy per ToR endpoint, connect it to a request with it's own port number and you're good for that one request, same for multiple requests. You can build a task scheduler to orchestrate the url to scrape and the port number the tor endpoint is on and have the entire application running on a cloud service provider to ensure you face no bandwidth issues.  The demo centered around the talk will attempt to rapidly and quickly scrape users from the famous social network Ask.fm which is known to restrict users from retreiving from their site if you attempt to download more than 4 users in under a second, but with the hack in place, you'll be retrieving close to maximum efficiency on a DigitalOcean droplet , but this can be applied to virtually any website and any cloud provider.  Never pay for webscraping again!  Thanks and see you at PyCon! \n-Lokesh Poovaraga",

    "Description": "Python is an amazing language, known for its vast standard library and use in rapid prototyping. When we were trying to build a robotics system that is primarily modular and upgradeable, we ended up using Python to power the brain of the project.  In this talk, we'll discuss how we designed the event loop, responsible for controlling the mechanical actions and state of a robot snake.   Animating multiple motors concurrently at different speeds to different positions.  Foreground and background tasks.  Interrupting ongoing tasks.   We will discuss best practices when performing asynchronous actions in Python, and how to ensure actions are completed within a bounded time.\nFinally we touch one of the lesser known 'features' of Python, the Global Interpreter Lock.  GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing at once. Two threads calling a function may take twice as much time as a single thread calling the function twice. We'll discuss some of the real world implications of the GIL, along with some considerations that must be taken while writing highly synchronous Python code",

Static typing is one of remedies that can improve readability and maintainability of the code.  That's why Python now features optional static typing as described in PEP-484 , implemented as Mypy .  Mypy is an experimental variant of Python that let's you add optional type annotations to type check your Python code. And it works great on both Python 2.7 and 3.3+.  Adopting static typing is easier that you think, you can start on a small set of code and move on to bigger pieces.  In this talk I'll share about,   PEP-484 and Introduction of type annotations in Python 3.5  Use cases of Mypy and how to use it with Python 2 and 3  Project typeshed and how to leverage it  Lessons I learned by type hinting the project Twine   We\u2019ll also discuss how to make it a seamless part of your project; what order to approach things in; and some powerful new packages that make it even easier today to add static types to your Python codebase than ever before",

    "Description": "The Jupyter ecosystem of tools lets you interleave code and stories for a literate computing experience, where you can visualize your data as html, plain text, svg and images. You could also view the same rich displays in multiple environments - on the web, on your desktop, in your shell or even your IDE . But how is this possible without duplicating logic, re-inventing the wheel multiple times? How do visualization libraries like Bokeh, Plotly work across frontends - like jupyter notebook, jupyterlab and nteract?  This talk explores Jupyter's display system and how it handles multiple display formats in multiple environments. We will see how this idea is applied in some open visualization libraries.  After this talk, you will know how to integrate your python objects better with the notebook. You will also get an idea of how to create a visualization library that works across the Jupyter ecosystem of tools.  Duration 45 mins (Content can be modified to fit into 30-minute slot too)  Outline - Setting some terminology for the rest of the talk (what is a frontend, kernel, displayhooks) (5 mins) - How to use Jupyter's display hooks for your python objects with the notebook (10 mins) - The Jupyter messaging protocol - specifically, the display_data and update_data messages (5 mins) - Custom mime-types (and this is the secret to Jupyter's display system!) - separating what to display from how to display it (10 mins) - Examples of custom mime-types in the wild (a look at altair , vdom , plotly and more) (10 mins)  Additional notes This proposal might seem to overlap with another - Jupyter Notebooks: Internals and Extension - which explores how jupyter works under the hood and how to create alternative frontends.

    "Description": "With the advent of Tableau and languages like Python and R, converting raw data into meaningful insights is much easier and convenient than before. Tableau is a tool used to visually represent data and is powerful enough to analyze the given data at any required level. At an industry perspective, the tool comes handy in finding the trends in marketing and sales with a click of a button.  Introducing Python to Tableau using TabPy can help define calculated fields in Python, thereby giving it the power to leverage a large number of Machine-learning libraries right from the visualizations. This widens the scope of its applications to any field that deals with big data and its analytics. Optimisation and cross-sharing of data models facilitated by TabPy immensely enhance the efficiency and usability of the tool. With just a few lines of code, we can churn out predictive models and increase the accuracy of future predictions.  The talk will primarily focus on:   An introduction to data manipulation and visualization using Tableau.  An overview of the steps to leverage TabPy in Tableau.  The impact and advantages of Tableau-TabPy combination in the real world.",

    "Description": "Mention of \u201cCancer\u201d evokes words like tumor, chemotherapy, hair loss, vomiting and pain. Interestingly our knowledge and thereby cancer treatment has changed radically in the past few years and is changing rapidly every passing day. In 2003, human genome was sequenced and for the first time we could read entire human DNA from end to end. Interestingly DNA and cancer are deeply connected. Scientists deciphered that always a change in DNA (mutation) led to cancer (oncogenic mutation). Cigarette smoking, alcohol, pollution etc only led to such DNA change (oncogenic mutations). This led to numerous diagnostic companies starting to extract and sequence tumor DNA, to detect the root cause of each patient tumor. While drug companies formulated new drugs that targeted specific DNA change (mutation). These were called targeted therapies which were very different from chemotherapy in being very precise, less toxic, less side effects and they could be taken orally just like any regular pill. Thus, an oncologist (cancer doctor) could treat a cancer tumor effectively if s/he knew the precise location of mutation in the entire patient tumor DNA and the drug that targeted it. Suddenly oncologists in India and elsewhere, found themselves struggling to comprehend tumor DNA and the technology around it. Already burdened with tomes of ever changing patient treatment guidelines, now they were needed to integrate tumor DNA information to make accurate treatment decisions. For eg. NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, USA) which publishes treatment guidelines for all cancer for oncologists across the world, published lung cancer guidelines that is 271 pages long. To this, add the complex data of patient\u2019s tumor DNA, various mutation databases, clinical trials and research papers. Modern day oncologist are often overwhelmed. They need tools to simplify and hasten their decision making. I am a molecular biologist who understands the tumor DNA and the technologies around it. As Chief Scientist (molecular oncology) of Neuberg diagnostic lab, I also write patient DNA reports that guide oncologists to take treatment decisions.  While meeting various oncologists and marketing them different DNA tests for different type of cancers, I got acutely aware of the problems oncologists faced. To simplify their decision making, I created algorithms that combined patient\u2019s clinical history, histo-pathology data, molecular test decisions, mutational databases and NCCN guidelines. Subsequently I coded these integrated and complex decision algorithms as Python programs that can be executed from a browser. They are available for free and oncologists are/can use it.\nPrograms in Python for lung cancer and colorectal cancers: https://sites.google.com/view/molecularpathology/programming?authuser=0 \nMy article on need of Python programing for cancer treatment: https://sites.google.com/view/molecularpathology/programming/is-it-time-for-precision-medicine-app?authuser=",

    "Description": "Kubernetes is considered as the new Kernel of the Cloud. It's a distributed computing platform letting users not have to care about infra and helping them concentrate mainly on business logic. By having your web app deployed on a kubernetes cluster you can make sure your app is highly available, and can fail-over when there's a problem.  One of the main goals of the Kubernetes project is to democratize distributed computing. With Kubernetes being open source, Companies do not have to redo the mundane task of writing a distributed computing platform to achieve high availability, automated deployment, scaling and management of your applications. Kuberentes will take care of that for you. Kubernetes is also considered as a container orchestrator, as it manages containers to achieve the above said goals.  In this talk:    We will first write a basic python web app.    Next, We will go through what a container is    Containers are becoming the de-facto way of deploying applications as they remove the complexities of dependency management,etc.    Running apps on Individual Containers provide the isolation almost to that of a Virtual Machine without having the overhead of having individual Kernels as they all share the host kernel. Isolation is provided by using kernel level features like cgroups and namespaces.    We will containerize the application using docker and push it to a Container Registry.    Once we have the image deployed to a registry, this image will be used to create instances i.e containers of the web app.      We will next create a kubernetes cluster on Azure, all along going through what a Kubernetes cluster is, and its components.    We will then deploy our python web app onto the cluster. Now As we have our python web app up and running, We can then do some experiments on how Kubernetes self-heals the application when a node goes down,etc.    After that I will run down some points on where Kubernetes is being\n   used, its impact.    To Finally answer the question, Is Containers and Kubernetes worth all the Hype ?  This talk will be demo focused, But before going to a demo we will have some slides explaining the overview of the components and how they work.  By the end of the talk, Audience will have a brief overview of what containers and kubernetes are, and how to deploy a web app on Kubernetes. From this overview, Audience can start digging deeper online and know more",

    "Description": "Abstract  One of the feature people love about Python is how it\u2019s dynamically typed. A lot of people are very reluctant on hearing this idea of static typing, they will come back bashing on what's the use of Python then when we introduce static typing in it.  With the torch bearers of Python in the industry like Google, Quora, Instagram, and a lot of others retaining their stack on Python and introducing static checking there have to be some non-superficial benefits, which are worth discussing.  This is Python  class Employee(NamedTuple):\n    name: str\n    id: int = 3\n\ndef fib(n: int) -> Iterator[int]:\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    while a < n:\n        yield a\n        a, b = b, a+b  Contents of the talk   What's static typing  Need of static typing  Static typing in Python 3.6  Type checkers  Demo  mypy vs pytype  Pros and Cons  QnA and discussion",

I\u2019m Vishal Gupta, a 3rd yr CSE undergrad at SSN, Chennai, India. \nWhile most people generally pick up a topic, or a concept (like say Computer Vision, Big Data, or just Algorithms), understand it and aspire to excel at it\u2026 I fell in love with a language, Python. As someone who has started out by learning C++ in school, learning Python was as easy as surprising. The speed at which I could translate ideas to code was amazing, and oh boy, all I wanted to do was make things, write simple scripts to automate everyday tasks. And hence I continued to explore Python, the countless modules and possibilities with Python. I went to Hackathons, won some but more importantly made something that others could use.  Chatbots and me  UI/UX has never been my strong suit but Chatbots made it simple to use serve any application in a conversational manner. Over the last 2 years, I have developed over a dozen chatbot for a variety of purposes, from fetching torrent links to code education to keeping track of events. One of my best messenger chatbots is still functional with nearly ~500 subscriptions. PyGeon , scrapes a number of sites everyday for developer events such as meetups, hackathons and contests in 7 indian cities. Newly added events are sent to users every day.

I've been developing Python programs, scripts and softwares for over 2 years now and I come across people who have a problem of Python being slow. \nWhenever someone has to write a faster python code they are left with one option of just shifting their entire code from Python to C or C++. This talk will clear that misconception.  People can actually write faster codes in Python, the only missing fact is how? . And this is exactly why I am interested to give this talk.  Contents of the talk   The talk will start with a basic introduction of myself as a Python developer.  I will then talk about the misconception about shifting the code to C or C++.  Then I will proceed onto some basic usage of Python Programming Language.  Introduction to optimization techniques in Python.  Then I will talk about when and why should one optimize their application.  I will introduce the basic concepts of optimization in Python.  Tell people about the available/built-in functions that can come in handy.  Then I will proceed onto giving a demonstration on 'Writing better functions'.  The talk will conclude with some examples of optimized code that performs better than conventional approaches.  The talk will be open to questions, to make it more interactive and fun.

    "Description": "Bitcoin has been gaining popularity in the recent years due to its market value. But more importantly, the underlying technology is gaining the attention among the developers. Many developer communities inspired by bitcoin have created their own platform to use the underlying technology widely known as \"blockchain\" to achieve decentralization. Ethereum is one such platform that has created a blockchain platform which allows developers to develop their own decentralized applications (dApps) in the ethereum network by coding the logic in the execulatable contracts called \"smart contracts\" . Although ethereum has gained a huge fame due to its smart contract implementation to create decentralized applications, it imposes developer to write the logic in an ethereum's domain-specific language called Solidity. In addition to coding in a new language, it mandates the developer to set up a new develop environment.  NEO blockchain platform provides a convenient way to develop smart contracts in general purpose programming language. NEO achieves this by providing compilers to compile code written in most of the languages to bytecode that can be executed in NEO virtual machine. Currently, NEO allows compilation of python smart contracts through neo-python project.  This is the first blockchain project to provide such a freedom to the developer.  NEO project provides plenty of benefits over other blockchain platforms out there. \nIt plans to achieve smart economy by creating a strong digital identity. It achieves faster transaction rate which is the key to scale any platform. NEO is being referred to as the \"New Ethereum\" due to its increasing popularity.  I plan on conducting a workshop to create a decentralized application by developing and deploying smart contract using neo-python.  Following would be the agenda of the workshop.   Introduction to Bitcoin, Blockchain, and consensus to achieve decentralization. (30 mins)  Introduction to NEO and Setting up a NEO platform (30 mins)  Creating and deploying Hello World contract using Python (15 mins)  Creating a Proof of Ownership system (30 mins)  Creating a user interface to create a complete Proof of Ownership DApp. (20 mins)  Creating an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) using an existing template and Q&A (25 mins)   ** This is a rough estimation of time and topics as of now. I will try to fit more topics if possible.  An attendee will be able to create an asset management DApp such as document ownership system or launch a basic ICO after attending the workshop",

The reason I'm interested in taking this up is because there are people who develop beautiful things and might want to let people to use it even on a mobile interface. The problem is not everyone's good with app development. So in such cases, deploying the beautiful things in the form of a bot would be a great idea.  Bots can be of 2 types :   Conversational  Command based   I'll be taking up the command based bot to help people get a feeling of this topic.  Also, through the example I'll be giving, I'll try to make people understand as to what APIs are and how to use existing one. Later I'll show  them how to create your own Python APIs because APIs make lives easier for programmers and it's always a good practise to know how to create an API as you never know when someone else might need it.  CONTENTS AND ORDER OF THE TALK   I'll be starting off with an introduction about myself and then I'll move on to what are bots.  I'll then be explaining about why we could probably use these bots on Telegram, Discord, Slack and so on.  Thereafter I'll be talking about the Telegram API for Python to help you interact with the bot and telling you how to use it. Before this, I'll show them how to prepare a bot on Telegram and get the Token.  After this, I'll be talking about the importance of an API and utilizing existing ones as it makes your job much simpler.  Slowly, I'll shift my focus on to how to build an API. I'll be explaining this using an example.  Then using the Telegram Bot API and the API we build for Syntaxdb.com, we'll be creating a Telegram bot.  Lastly, I'll summarise and entire talk and will take up a couple of questions.   The entire talk will be based on a GitHub repository. The code links will be given to everyone for future reference",

    "Description": "In computer vision, object detection is scanning and searching for an object in an image or a video (which is just sequence of images). Whereas, object tracking is like you are spying on someone and following it. Done in motion images like in animated gifs or videos, we want to track how an object is moving, where is it going, or its speed.  Although it has been studied for dozens of years, object detection and tracking remains an open research problem . The difficulty level of this problem highly depends on how you define the object to be detected and tracked. If only a few visual features, such as a specific color, are used as representation of an object, it is fairly easy to identify all pixels with same color as the object. On the other extremity, the face of a specific person, which full of perceptual details and interfering information such as different poses and illumination, is very hard to be accurately detected, recognized and tracked.  Thus, I believe it is important to address such challenges via a comparative study of object tracking and object detection in python. Here, I aim to present my own experience in tackling the problems while I tested different algorithms for the same",

    "Description": "Talk Abstract  This talk aims to introduce Facebook's Deep Learning library - PyTorch. PyTorch is increasing becoming popular due to it's powerful features and shallow learning curve, making it accessible and easy to use to a larger community. This talk discusses about the 'Autograd' package, which is central to all neural networks in PyTorch. It also entails details about the different features and functionalities of PyTorch as well as equip the audience on how to create simple and complex Neural Networks in PyTorch. PyTorch helps to create dynamic computation graphs that allow you to change how the network behaves on the fly unlike static computation graphs. It offers modularity which enhances the ability to debug or see within the network.  Outline of the Talk  The talk will be broadly divided into 3 broad parts.  Part 1 will be an Introduction to PyTorch. This part will focus on the use and need for PyTorch as a deep learning framework. This will be followed by instructions on how to setup PyTorch and a look at the basic building blocks behind the framework.  Part 2 will dive more into the features of PyTorch, mainly it's AutoGrad package which lies at the heart of all Neural Networks created in PyTorch and PyTorch's ability to create dynamic computational graphs as opposed to the static computational graphs offered by some of it's counterparts (such as TensorFlow and Caffe).  Part 3 will be a more 'hands on' part where the talk will focus on how to create and build simple as well as complex neural networks (such as Convolutional Neural Networks) with the framework",

Typically, when your Python project grows beyond a few modules and your team size is more than a couple of developers, having the right tools built into your project development workflow saves one from a lot of surprises (and perhaps late night calls). In this talk, we start with challenges typically seen in Python Projects and look at ways of overcoming them, so that the velocity of code deployment increases. Specifically we are going to be looking at tools that are out there that allow you to -   Properly track dependencies ( pip , virtualenv and the new Pipenv )  Have a separate Dev and Production environment - so that dependencies in Dev environment don't spill into Production environment.  Ensure that the builds are deterministic (across developer/build machines and time.)  Enforce certain coding guidelines and capture the potential 'run-time' errors right during the development ( pylint )  and Eventually Dockerize your application.",

In this talk we'll be going through the concepts behind such snippets in detail, so that next time when you see such examples, the answer seems natural to you.  Finally, we'll try to answer some interesting questions like,   How does string concatenation work?  What's the best way of building large strings in Python?

What can you expect from this workshop!   You'll understand what are convolution neural networks  Why they work so well on image data?  All the different implementation of Convolution network and how they improve the vanilla network  What are the best ways to implement convolution network on a given data   What this workshop is not!   Just another workshop telling you to use frameworks  Maths will not be looked over. (It's important)  This workshop is not any other university lecture where you'll not understand anything.

In case, you've not written your application with localization and internationalization in mind, then  \"Boy! You're in danger! You should better start praying to almighty to give you strength and endurance to support yet another language in your app\".  In this talk, we'll see how do we support localization and serve our app in different languages, based on what language the client wants to communicate in. As a backend, we should be language agnostic and allow all clients to communicate with us in one of the languages we support.  We'll see how to support translation for static data (using makemessages / compilemessages) and dynamic data, using various third-party services such as django-translations and transifex.  Here, static data is translations for all the fields, error messages etc. that the app already has and dynamic data is the custom data input by the user in the app.  This would enable you to have your admin panel, as well as RESTful APIs, served in different languages",

Mozilla\u2019s DeepSpeech and Common Voice projects are there to change this. In contrast to classic STT approaches, DeepSpeech features a modern end-to-end deep learning solution. Based on Baidu's Deep Speech research paper, it trains a model by machine learning techniques. This model directly translates raw audio data into text - without any domain specific code in between. To train systems like DeepSpeech, an extremely large amount of voice data is required. Most of the data used by large companies isn\u2019t available to the majority of people.

    "Description": "Take it from someone who has introduced an exorbitantly high number of bugs in empty files for most of his life: debugging is hard indeed. But since the dawn of time, developers have been debugging code: there's no escaping that. Software testing, as the elders would tell you, is one of the greatest weapons in your arsenal against those bugs. It's easy to write tests. It helps you write more robust software. And it really helps you sleep at night: and your on-call ops team would love you! But testing is also deeply mystified, unfortunately. Beginners, and sometimes even seasoned developers, generally have a difficult time just to get started: so they eventually miss out on this easy way to attain peace of mind.  This talks aims at removing all the mystery around software testing in Python, and give the attendees a head-start into the easiest way of writing tests for their code. As part of being a Python developer for the past 8 years and leading a team of developers building enterprise-grade software for the past 4 years, I've learnt immensely about the important role of software testing in building scalable, durable software; and also a better, pragmatic way of thinking about testing in Python. This talk aims at providing a distilled version of my learning to the audience: both beginners to Python, and seasoned Pythonistas.  The talk would broadly cover these topics:   A formal way of thinking about software testing / Why you should even bother about writing tests?  Writing the simplest of tests in Python / Brief exploration of unittest and pytest  Introduction to mocking in Python / In-depth exploration of mock and how to effectively use it for mocking any type of scenario in your code  Writing tests for complex applications / working code examples from real life  A few (opinionated) recommendations about testing   Apart from providing to the audience an easy-to-grasp framework of thinking about software testing, this talk aims to teach by examples from real world. Complex and not so straightforward concepts would be explained with code samples and tests from production, so it's easy for the audience to truly grasp them. The talk also features anecdotes from my own experience in building software to give the audience better context",

    "Description": "Abstract  Think of wireless internet, but has the wire somewhere. Serverless architecture still has the server behind :P.  What serverless actually means that developer should focus on the code rather than thinking about the servers. As a technique, it removes most of the manel parts of an application, so you can actually spend your day coding. This means that you, developers, can quickly create apps that handle production-ready traffic. You do not have to actively manage scaling for your applications. You do not have to provision the server, or to pay for resources that are unused. The serverless movement started with the release of AWS Lambda, a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) compute service. But serverless is much more than just FaaS  Chatbots have been around for quite a long time. But why this sudden surge and interest in chatbots now? Well, there are various reasons. Unlike the earlier days, many AI and NLP capabilities are now available as consumable services. Also, serverless technologies make chatbots easier to build and scale. The question is, how is the backend served? Would you set up a dedicated server (or a cluster of servers)? That\u2019s costly, painful, and time-consuming! or You will deploy it to Heroku, which will eventually sleep (only happens in the free tier) if no one uses your chatbot.  Imagine suddenly, traffic increased your chatbot is used by thousands of people at a time.  When Heroku free tier is over, the application crashed or you exceeded memory limit. What would you do now? That\u2019s where serverless technology can help.   Benefits of serverless    No Administration - We can deploy our code without provisioning anything beforehand, or manage anything afterward. There is no concept of a fleet, an instance, or even an operating system.    Scalability - One doesn't have to care about auto-scaling,  No need to show alerts or write scripts to scale up and down. With serverless, we can handle quick bursts of traffic.    Cost - Function-as-a-service (FaaS) compute and managed services charged based on actual usage rather than pre-provisioned capacity. This means one pay the amount we use, so if we use service for 10 sec then we pay for 10 sec.    Faster Development - Now loop between having an idea and deploying to production is shortened because no one need to manage anything after deployment, smaller teams can ship more features. It's easier than ever to make your idea live.    Easy Integration With Other Services Going serverless allows a seamless integration to various other cloud services from the same provider. For example, if you are using the AWS platform for chatbots, then you can use DynamoDB for the database, write programming logic as Lambda functions, and expose them through the API Gateway.    Session key Takeaways  The main question is how to write code which is serverless compliant. This is where this session will help you. This talk will help people to move a step ahead of the traditional way of writing code as some of you had already developed chatbot, I will share how can you can write the simple chatbot in python and can take leverage of serverless to deploy and publish. I will cover   Serverless Framework principals  AWS Lambda, Amazon Lex and API Gateway  How to write a chatbot in python and create a Lambda function  How to troubleshoot in a serverless world",

    "Description": "Abstract  The primary purpose of this talk to describe how we are using python and Sklearn to model and analyse time series sensor data. In particular, I will walk through how we use Python to process data from an IoT enabled sensor attached to a cricket bat, build machine learning models on the data, and use open source tools to deploy our models in the sensor device as a smart IoT application.  Description  With the steep increase in the number of smart-things connected to the internet, the amount of data that is being generated by such devices is increasing exponentially. However, much of that data is not useful and therefore filtering unuseful data is an important task. How do we filter the important part and remove the noise from sensor data streams to generate actionable insights?  To demonstrate the problem we are placing a sensor device on a cricket bat. The IoT device is a miniaturised, wireless MEMS inertial measurement unit (IMU). The IMU incorporates three-axis sensing of bat acceleration and angular velocity with a low-power Bluetooth to transmit this data to a mobile.  First, we gather event-based data rather than storing the entire stream. This again poses the question: how do we define an event? What makes an event unique from the surrounding \u2018non-event\u2019 context? These are some of the questions that need to be answered in order to define an event. Watching a cricket batter stand and prepare to swing, the human brain continuously filters its visual perception and is able to detect and differentiate a swing from the pre- and post-swing activity. We need to be able to automate that same process. Some data instances can be tagged while other can\u2019t be. This helps in training and evaluating machine learning models later.  Secondly, After we have extracted time series data based on the instances, we can start analysing these event-based sets of data to understand the language of sensor data. For this, we are using Jupyter Lab to interactively work with data. How does an accelerometer data depict the real world physical motion? This step helps us find the relation between the real world actions and the sensor data set. Well, the extraction process will be prone to noises.  The data comes in CSV files, python seems the right choice for us to read and analyse the data. Pandas and offer data frames that come handy to rapidly form and validate hypothesis interactively in Jupyter notebooks. Any analysis is incomplete without visualisation, that's where Matplotlib helps us understand the data better. We quickly test the machine learning models by using Sklearn, which has most of the standard algorithms already implemented. This keynote will describe some of the analysis (along with python code) to show how we have taken several steps right from forming the hypothesis to implementing a solution in the device level layer. All of this demonstrates how Python and its rich set of libraries are helpful in forming solutions to some of the product related features.  Thirdly, we need to automate the task of classifying a particular instance from the stream. For this to happen, we can either feed a machine learning model or create a rule-based algorithm which can classify the events into buckets.  Now every step has its own set of challenges, firstly the application we are working on involves using motion sensors attached to the back of a cricket bat. There are network constraints in the field. If a sportsperson wants to know real-time analytics from the device, the segregation needs to happen offline. We have to deploy the models on the miniature sensor devices because sometimes the players don\u2019t even carry their mobile phones to the playing area. Therefore our objective is to enable the devices to remain independent in running machine learning algorithms by themselves",

    "Description": "Millions of visitors visit business websites every day and each one of them takes different set of steps in order to seek the right information/product. Yet most of them leave disappointed or dejected for some reason and very few get to the right page within the website. In this kind of situation, it becomes difficult to find out if the visitor actually got the information that he was looking for? Also, the individual journeys of these visitors can\u2019t be compared to each other since every visitor has done different set of activities. So, how can we know more about these journeys and compare these visitors to each other?\nSequence Embedding is a powerful way that offers us the flexibility to not only compare any two distinct visitors entire journey in terms of similarity but also to predict the probability of visitor\u2019s conversion. Sequence embeddings essentially helps us to move away from using traditional features to make predictions and considers not only the order of the activities of a user but also the average time spent on each of the unique pages to translate into more robust features and used in Supervised Machine Learning across multiple use cases (next possible action prediction, converted vs non-converted, product classification)\u00a0.Using traditional Machine learning models on the advanced features like sequence embeddings, we can achieve tremendous results in terms of prediction accuracy but the real benefit lies in visualizing all these user journeys and observing how distinct are these paths from the ideal ones.  This session will unfold the process creating sequence embeddings for each user\u2019s journey in python and use them to build machine learning classification model to predict visitor conversion along with comparing all the user journeys in terms of similarity score",

    "Description": "Geospatial representation are so prevalent in day to day life, such as even in simple travel related conversation to maps, aerial/satellite images etc. In digital era, geospatial data is extensively produced and consumed in ever growing proportion. Python with its free and open source libraries are giving wide variety yet simple and effective set of tools to visualise and analyse geospatial data. The current workshop is directed for beginners of Python programming language, who have basic understanding on computing and data formats. The primary objective of the workshop is to introduce and give hands on training on selected list of FOSS libraries for geospatial analysis. The workshop as a do it yourself fashion tries to solve two real world problems in Geographical Information System (GIS) and its geospatial data sources.  The workshop comprised of three components:  Component 1  Python environment and work flow setup, an assisted task of setting up the Docker and Jupyter notebook setup. Setting up the Geographical Information System (GIS) environment with extended discussion. Setting up of GIS tools such as FOSS QGIS and Google earth. This component is comprised of four exercises. 1. Introduction to vector data, 2. Introduction to raster data, 3. binary and text file formats of geospatial data, 4. Introduction to tools of GIS, 5. Introduction to literal programming- Jupyter notebook  Component 2  Find characteristics of road network(type of road network, length of the type) within a 1X1 km grid. The data source is Open Street Map (OSM) road network data on a city level (60X60km size). This operation is operationally simple such as measure a line feature but computationally intensive as the operation comprised of geometry within operation on dense road network seen in urban setup. Libraries such as Shapely, Fiona, Geopandas and rtree index will be used for the fast processing of this operation. This component comprised of three exercises 1. Find distance between two points 2. Find distance between two points constrained by another vector 3. Find distance between large number of points in for loop  Component 3  Find cloud cover percentage over area of interest. The data source is Landsat satellite imagery. Searching cloud free Landsat images over an Area of Interest for a temporal extent of a year or more is manual and time consuming. Applying cloud cover detection algorithm could make this operation automatic. Libraries such as rasterio, Geopandas, Fiona, and libraries related to landsat algorithms will be used for this task. This component comprised of two exercises 1. Convert the imagery in geotiff into numpy arrays 2. Apply the algorithms to find the cloud cover  Workshop Plan   Introduction and setup- 30 minutes  Component 1- 30 minutes  Component 2- 45 minutes  Component 3- 45 minutes",

    "Description": "Ever wondered if you could build your own deep learning framework for hundreds of users? Well, we did build one and turns out it's not as hard as it sounds.  With thousands of people working towards democratising artificial intelligence (AI) , we have seen an explosion in the availability of machine learning libraries that make it simpler to build and deploy models for a wide range of tasks. From finance to art, every field has been revolutionised by the  introduction of AI.   At the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) we work on understanding the fundamental particles that constitute the universe by performing various experiments in particle physics. Of late, we have experienced a stratospheric rise in deep learning applications to various problems - RNNs, CNNs, and GANs - that have yielded promising results.  Like, this stuff is craaazy, dude. It works!  We delve into the development of one such project as it evolves from a set of scripts into a full-blown framework with multifarious applications in high-energy physics.   In this talk we will detail the evolution on the DeepJet Python environment. Specifically, we will start with the problem(s) we were facing and how we evolved from a set of scripts hastily patched together to a structured, cross-platform framework built on top of Tensorflow and Keras.    The library is a WIP so we're shipping updates on a daily basis with the goal of improving usability with focus on documenting our existing code base.     Initially envisaged to support the development of the namesake jet-tagger in the CMS Experiment at CERN, it has grown to encompass multiple purposes within the collaboration. It is aimed at outlining how to go from a set of scripts to building a library that is used by hundreds of scientists in the world's largest physics research collaboration.    The presentation will describe the major features the environment sports: simple out-of-memory training a with multi-threaded approach to maximally exploit the hardware acceleration, simple and streamlined I/O to help bookkeeping of the developments, and finally Docker image distribution, to simplify the deployment of the whole ecosystem on multiple datacenters.    The talk will also cover future development, mainly aimed at improving user experience. ",

    "Description": "So you started learning python, and you have been able to stitch few lines of code together and it worked, but you do not know why, then this is the talk for you.  We will delve into elementary yet obscure concepts that are more often than not skipped by beginners eg why is   if _ name_ == _ main_   required in python scripts. et el.  In a 3 hour power packed interactive and fully-hands on workshop we shall be learning python from ground up using examples from the real world.  Basics of python will be covered with less emphasis on the basics of programming itself.  The topics to be covered during the workshop shall include but not be limited to:   Hello World  Variables  Loops and conditionals  String  Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples.  functions  File handling  classes  modules and imports  lambda, map and reduce  decorators and generators  raising and handling exceptions  sample exercises for the attendees to work on based on the concepts covered in the first half of the workshop.",

    "Description": "Each step we take we are closing in into a world of Artificial General Intelligence .  All these so called modern inventions ignite a feeling of astonishment among newbie developers across the globe - seeking answers to how these things work from the very basic level. There are myriad resources available on the internet theorising machine learning algorithms.  But - what these resources lack is something that can bridge the gap between the theoretical concepts and the actual coding aspects. When a relatively novice developer skim through the code of these libraries he can barely understand what exactly is going on behind the recondite code. In the midst of making the code efficient  these libraries often come up with chunks of code which are barely comprehensible.  fromscratchtoml  The primary goals of this library is -   to bridge the gap between the theoretical and coding aspects of machine learning algorithms.  To write intuitive blogs as python notebooks so as to juxtapose theory and code . Explaining the fundamentals of the algorithm from the very basics.  To minimise the use of external dependencies except the fundamental ones like numpy and matplotlib .  To make sure that the developed algorithms are coherent with already existing machine learning frameworks.    The library is still in a nascent stage but will take shape in a couple of months. Given that the commit frequency is huge. The audience is requested to be patient.   LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) -  When you are writing a machine algorithm from scratch you want to make sure that your results are coherent and your model is learning the features it is meant to learn. LIME explains why your model behaved the way it did.   I will quote excerpts from their blog below -  Imagine we want to explain a classifier that predicts how likely it is for the image to contain a tree frog. We take the image on the left and divide it into interpretable components (contiguous superpixels).      As illustrated below, we then generate a data set of perturbed instances by turning some of the interpretable components \u201coff\u201d (in this case, making them gray). For each perturbed instance, we get the probability that a tree frog is in the image according to the model. We then learn a simple (linear) model on this data set, which is locally weighted\u2014that is, we care more about making mistakes in perturbed instances that are more similar to the original image. In the end, we present the superpixels with highest positive weights as an explanation, graying out everything else.   Even from a human's perspective these explanations do make sense.  BONUS - MrMark (A personal customisable assistant integrated with Google assistant ) -    I am going to use Mr. Mark to vocally invoke commands like ' open LIME explanations for RNN , train CNN for face recognition ` etc..

    "Description": "Almost all developers spend countless hours on configuring, tweaking and micro-managing their dotfiles with an obsession to exactly have them like one wants them to be. I do too .  Dotfiles are just configuration files like .vimrc and .gitconfig on your OS, that stores the settings you have for applications/environments/tools to make life easier while giving you more portability.  Well, do you have to use bash scripts for initial setups of your dotfiles? or do you want to setup your dotfiles but don't want to learn or be limited by  Bash? Do you forget to update/maintain your dotfiles periodically? Do you struggle with the installation of applications later on? \n Well, Python could be the answer to all of your problems. With Python, one can easily manage , maintain and do a lot more with their dotfiles.    My talk would start with a basic intro of what exactly are Dotfiles? and what is the common way of setting them up? This helps beginners who are new to the topic, get interested and a quick recap of why dotfiles are important for all developers.    Building up the momentum by visual queues and comparisons through slides, I would show how exactly Python does the same using Homely as Bash does. Later, work through the more intricate details by talking about the features one can implement using Homely and Python highlighting limitations of bash. Like Automation , Logging , git control , debugging , installation of applications and so much more .    Summing up by demonstrating a number of scripts that I will be preparing in-advance to showcase the same features that we just talked about. This helps people grasp the talk, the topic, and \" the why we are doing, what we are doing \" part.    Ending the talk , with a round of questions and showing the setup I use after months of searching through dotfiles repositories to leave them open to all the options they can choose from for setting up their dotfiles and pick the best setup from the knowledge they just gained.

    "Description": "DNS is a non-encrypted protocol. DNS responses which are sent over UDP or TCP lack confidentiality, privacy and security. DNS often contains password files, geolocations, email service and fax numbers, certificate identity and pinning for TLS and much more. Parsing DNS without encryption would lead to different vulnerabilities such as eavesdropping and spoofing.  DNS over HTTPS(DoH) is a web protocol that argues for sending DNS requests and receiving DNS responses via HTTPS connections, hence providing query confidentiality. DoH provides more than just privacy \u2013 it also helps guarantee the integrity of the response users receives their requests. Because the DNS response is invisible between responder and user, ISPs and others in the end-to-end network chain can't interfere with the responses. Moreover, Responses from the use of recursive resolvers to clients are the most vulnerable to undesired or malicious changes, because generally recursive resolvers do not encrypt any of your queries.  Henceforth, we would be discussing the implementation and parsing of DNS over HTTPS. Further, we provided added support for handling IPv4 and IPv6 DNS packets (A + AAAA records) as well as support for EDNS for edns-client-subnet usage. The integration with HTTP provides a transport suitable for traditional DNS clients seeking access to the DNS. In the end, we will discuss how our client will be sending DNS queries and get DNS responses over HTTP using https:// and implies TLS security integrity and confidentiality.  Furthermore, I plan to put some light on how DNSSEC validation is getting involved here with DNS resolution through HTTP to provide ultimate privacy and security support for \n the DNS packets",
